There are a few exceptions to this rule. If title revokation law is active, ruler can refuse inhertaince to slow, imbecile inbred or incapable characteres. If religious title revoke law is active ruler can also refuse inheritance to infidels/heretics, and excommunicated characters of their own religion. Finally, ruler can refuse inheritance to characters who are known to have comitted a crime.

MAJOR: The "German" culture has been entirely reworked.
- Starting with the "Millenium" bookmark and on all Germans will be split into regional variants
- For bookmarios prior to "Millenium" Germans will start as a mono-culture but diverge over time
- This process cannot be stopped however an exceptionally strong German emperor that holds uncontested control of the entire region of Germania can attempt to enforce a unified "Imperial German" culture over time
- These various German sub-cultures will treat each other as different cultures in matters of opinion but are unlikely to want to fracture from a Germanic overlord
- These changes have also been reflected in the EU4 converter
- If you do not want this, either in early or late bookmarks, there is a game rule to revert to vanilla Germans from the very start

Plus day-one decisions transfered to game rules.
Supernatural events are by default turned OFF.

Emperors of Imperial realms can no longer be the target of claimant factions for their own duke/king titles.
Fixed two imperial court events that had mislabeled options.
Fixed the War of Two Eriks revolt CB -- again.
Family members serving in the empire's capital now gain imperial traits much more quickly.

4.04.2

A number of events have been added to empires based on the presence of courtiers in the top liege's court with either the Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard trait. One of these is likely to pop up every 5-10 years, and can lead to both good and bad effects -- from reforms being suggested to an increase in Imperial Decadence to an intrigue within the court or a claim upon the emperor's title.
Emperors can no longer use 'Make Title Inheritable' decision upon themselves.
The Patriarch Supreme no longer vassalizes themselves to the emperor over Rome if and when they usurp Rome, if they already have an emperor as their liege.
Councils in an Imperial realm should give preference to counts/dukes who are inside or bordering the viceroy realm when suggesting alternate picks.
Updated a number of events to use the new 'educator' scope and not break when the AI doesn't assign an actual guardian at age 6.
Threat is now lowered when granting a vassal independence.
Fixed the Kharijite Rebellion event to not invalidate the CB.
Fixed tournament winners sometimes being calculated incorrectly and not properly favoring the highest Martial attendees.
Relinquishing a viceroy title for a favor also increases Imperial Decadence, the same as accepting a bribe.
Fixed the "Restored Roman Borders" event to actually look for more than central Anatolia provinces.
Fixed Imperial Decadence so it actually reduces the liege's levy totals and the levies from their vassals.
Dealing with a province where a religious or nationalist rebellion began will now also stop similar rebellions in realm provinces of the same religion/culture for up to 3 years, depending on the harshness of the example.
Fixed a bug which made the Ecumenical Patriarch *more* likely to refuse your coronation if he didn't hate you.
An Ecumenical Patriarch who refuses to coronate the Byzantine emperor may now be asked again in three years, rather than ten.
Rebels and adventurers no longer get free money until *after* they achieve victory.
Fixed a bug where landless rebels/adventurers could hire mercenaries after their forces were destroyed, putting those mercenaries in limbo and thus eventually causing a crash.
The Conclave adolescent education events have been re-written to a make a bit more sense -- so you're not always ending up a rival with your ward for making them ambitious, for instance.
Guardians may now be assigned at age 5, same as when the focus alert comes up.
The AI will not form claimant factions against an AI religion head unless they are cynical.

4.04.1

Fixed the 'Create Provincia' decisions to account for the map changes.
Fixed the faction demand for a liege's title so that it works again.
Removed starting alliance between Khazars/Cumans in the OG bookmark, as it would occasionally make everyone allied with everyone.
The Byzantine minor title Despot has been made a councillor.
Added a historical war between the Almoravids and Ghana in 1066
Made formation of regular titular kingdoms by the AI less common.
Increased population-per-empty province limit for nomads.
Added event to have provinces along the trade routes in West Africa possibly convert to Cairo's religion between 900 and 1050 if they are unreformed Pagan.
Added event to have provinces along the Amber Road in Eastern Europe possibly convert to Byzantium's or Poland's religion between 1000 and 1150 if they are unreformed Pagan.
Changed the localisation for nomadic Magyars.
AI Altaic tribal rulers who have a few provinces and high Martial and enough prestige may now switch to Nomadic government.
Courtiers in the capital of an empire now have a chance of gaining one of three traits over time: Imperial Bureaucrat, Imperial Courtier, or Imperial Guard. These will give them a bonus to their traits, and also prompt them to seek employment as councillors elsewhere in the empire should the Imperial court begin to get full.
Adjusted the flow of the West African trade network
Fixed the 'Sidhe Offerings' event so it only has one possible outcome that fires.
Fixed (hopefully) the occasional liberation revolt result where province capital holdings are changed.
A liege with Imperial Government revoking a feudal title now properly reverts that title to remain Imperial even when granted to a new vassal.
Tribal AI will now sometimes use tributary CB against targets which they cannot subjugate.
Rollo will no longer use tribal/norse CB's.
The old pagan mystic who shows up at your court now appears with higher Health, so there's less chance of them dying immediately.
The "Go Pagan" conversion event will now also convert all close relative and same-dynasty courtiers.
Unreformed pagans may now use the 'Attempt Religious Conversion' decision, though they must spend Prestige to do so. The AI will not do so unless it is Zealous.
Heritage focus can now be taken for a child before the age of 6.
The 'Ask Permission for Heritage Focus' diplo-decision can no longer be used on a child if you're their actual liege.
Added a 'Scourge Province' decision (usable on count title) which allows a non-reformed pagan to scourge an owned province of their culture but a different religion, giving them a chance at converting the province at the expense of tyranny and an unrest modifier for five years.
Added more variability to the strength of nationalist rebellions.
The 'Make Title Inheritable' decision is now only useable on vassals which have a regular succession law (ie. for non-primary type titles).
Fixed a bug preventing the firing of the "Sunset Invasion" even if you had the DLC
Added a customization feature that sets the chance for Aztecs to appear to be identical to the chance in vanilla CK2. This only appears for those with the "Sunset Invasion" DLC active.
If a pagan ruler refuses to allow your chaplain to stay to preach, you now have the option of having the chaplain remain secretly - with a chance to convert the province (or be caught while doing so). The pagan ruler has the option of just sending your chaplain home, but if he imprisons your chaplain right off the bat you will get a justified holy war against him and a claim on a random border province (if you border him).
The vanilla 'speaking in tongues' modifier is now removed whenever the Possessed trait is removed.
k_north_sea made de jure liege of d_iceland again.

4.04

MAJOR: map overhaul for the following regions: Africa and the Middle-East. Some areas have less provinces but their relative power should be relatively the same.
MAJOR: The vanilla viceroy system introduced with the Charlemagne DLC now no longer exists, and the viceroy realm laws can no longer be passed. Now, when dukes/kings in Imperial government realms (who themselves have Imperial government) either die or have their title usurped, their liege may decide whether to assent to the new holder. If they refuse, the new holder may simply elect to agree to the decision, offer a favor/bribe, or rebel. If they agree to the decision, then the emperor's council will offer up to three alternatives (which may include the new holder anyhow)...and the emperor can override this and take the title for themselves if they have enough Prestige.
An Imperial liege may make an Imperial vassal's title inherited. This is a diplo-decision, making the vassal either Feudal or Iqta and giving them the same opinion modifier they would get if they had been granted their primary title(s) by the liege outright. The title is inherited like a normal title from that point onwards, until and unless it is ever usurped (or revoked by the liege). Note that when a ruler first passes Imperial Administration and switches to Imperial government type, ALL feudal/iqta vassals are considered to have their titles inherited in this manner.
Note that Imperial government type no longer appears on the government map mode in the game lobby. It only appears upon game start.
Vassals with Imperial government may never create kingdom titles and may only create titular duchies.
There is now an Imperial Iqta government type, as well, which functions like Imperial government in all ways except it also has some of the features consistent with Iqta (holding temples, requiring piety to pass laws, etc.).
Major history overhaul for West Africa, including a new culture; Songhai.
Added the "Savanna" terrain type which is unique to the West African Region.
Fixed a bug preventing Brugge from building the land-based trade route buildings.
Bogomilists will now become theocracies once the religion is formalized, without needing to first be at war.
The Magyar Invasion CB is no longer available to Hungarians outside of the actual bookmark invasion scenario.
The 'Building Church of St. Bogomil' province modifier is now removed once the church is built.
The date can no longer manually be moved forward from the 1000 AD bookmark, only from the 1066 AD bookmark (as in vanilla).
Fixed government flavor file for Imperial governments.
Added a setup option to start the game with "Ancient Religions" replacing default ones while leaving nations intact. This option will disappear, like other similar setup ones, after the first day of any bookmark.
Fixed rare matrilineal marriage setting bug for titles created by event, but which only copy the owner's former primary title's laws after they are granted.
Disabled the "Colonization of Iceland" event chain as the final colonization step proved too buggy to function as expected consistently.
Adjusted the course of the Rhine and Danube rivers to be closer to where they should be.
Removed the Tyrant trait -- the tyranny opinion modifier added by defying your council could not be removed, sadly, so rather than have both the trait and the opinion modifier I've elected to simply get rid of the CK2Plus tyranny system completely. The effect of all diplo-actions such as imprisonment and banishment has been restored to vanilla values.
Ruler designed nomads will no longer cause the nomadic realm to split because clans are unhappy about the new dynasty ruling.
Increased maximum population for nomads received from empty holdings (and thus overall population growth).
Rollo now always has to fight for Normandy, rather than gaining the provinces by event if their holders are AI.
Added sicilians into province and character histories, thanks to user daniloy.
Close relatives of Dukes and Kings in empires (whether they have Imperial government or not) have a chance of asking to go to serve in the emperor's court for up to ten years if they have no pressing job back home. Should the emperor give them a councillor or commander position -- or a title -- they'll remain away until and unless they inherit. Otherwise they'll return after a time with either good effects (higher education trait, increased stat, a lifestyle trait, etc.) or bad (a bastard child, they become drunkard, they become depressed, etc.).
All emperors with Imperial Government now have the option of spending 100 Prestige and up to 5 Imperial Decadence (less if ID is already higher) to corrupt a corruptible council member and give them a +50 opinion bonus for five years. This can only be done once per year, and has the side-effect of potentially giving the councillor some additional negative traits.
'Claim the Imperial Throne' decision now available to all vassals of duke or higher tier in Imperial Government realms. It has been simplified to cost 1000 Prestige.
Added an 'Overthrow the Empire' plot useable in Imperial Government realms by member's of the emperor's council who have a claim on his primary title. This allows them to plan a coup in the imperial palace, one which involves all plotters as active participants (provided they are actually present in the capital) and can end with injury, death, or capture for any of the participants (including the ruler, so long as they are not away from the capital at the time).
EU4 Converter updated for version 1.15 of EU4 and 4.04.X of CK2+. Please note that development for the CK2+ to EU4 converter will be discontinued with the release of 1.16 of EU4.
Re-enabled 'Weaken Fellow Vassal' plot, now that viceroys no longer exist to screw it up.
Paulician priests may now both marry and inherit.

4.03.2

Added Imperial Government type, automatically applied to feudal rulers who pass the Imperial Administration law (and all their feudal vassals). They must maintain the Religious Control Mandate and Regulated Inheritance laws or be reverted to Feudal Government. This is (currently) the same as Feudal Government, but with the added benefit of free revocation on all duchy and kingdom titles.
Added a 'Women on the Council' law group under the Realm laws tab. This determines whether the roles of women on the ruler's council can be expanded from the default, and at its highest level provides the prerequisite for Absolute Cognatic succession. The maximum level also establishes a realm's status as 'feminist' if passed, meaning that the normal opinion malus for a female ruler or female heir will be removed.
The 'Expanded Women on the Council' law adds matrilineal marriage for republics and theocracies, which normally cannot have anything other than Agnatic succession.
Forts now require 30 days to build and have no bonuses as a base (they're only useful at that level for holding empty provinces). In order to receive fortification or garrison bonuses, they must be upgraded.
Fixed matrilineal marriages from becoming disallowed when a new primary title is created.
Female nomads created by the Ruler Designer now also get their primary title changed to Agnatic-Cognatic succession (after one day).
Rulers without a crown law title (such as independent dukes) may now pass the Revoke Title laws without worrying about Crown Authority.
Fabricated claims which were accidentally made super-cheap as of two versions ago have now been restored to their pricier, minimum costs.
Fixed missing descriptions for some of the new trade post buildings.
Negative events that occur during the Bogomilist formalization process now actually hinder the process rather than help it.
Formalizing the Bogomilist faith now removes the 'Formalizing Bogomilism' character modifier from the ruler.
Moved one of the Norse holy sites from Iceland to the western Isles since Iceland not populated in early bookmarks.
Fixed erroneous changing of province culture to liege culture via inappropriate assignation of 'Settle Tribe' steward job.
Reduced frequency of provinces converting to owner's culture.
Improved south slavic titles.
Fixed c_lorraine, c_messina, and c_reggio in the 1066 bookmark.
Fixed c_leinster and c_kilkenny in the 1000 bookmark.
Added upgradeable garrisons for all tradepost buildings, whether the holder is patrician or not.

4.03.1

Some tweaking to the values for Threat and Defensive Pacts (note that these values are in flux and will likely change further as we test them):
- 15% Threat is required for defensive pacts to be created (up from 5%)
- The maximum Threat gained from a single source is 14.5 (down from 50)
- 2.5 base Threat is gained per province gained as a flat value (instead of the 2-15 range in vanilla)
- base Threat decay lowered to a flat 0.06 (instead of the 0.21 to 0.4 range in vanilla)
- base Threat reduction when giving independence to titles reduced to 0
- No Threat is gained from titles that are inherited or vassals that are gained
Female rulers made with the Ruler Designer will now get the default Agnatic-Cognatic succession law, as intended.
Rulers that begin the game with Agnatic-Cognatic or True Cognatic succession (as opposed to those who are switched to it) will properly have matrilineal marriages allowed.
Rulers made with the Ruler Designer will now not start off having courtiers/vassals with negative opinions caused by being fired from the council.
Revolting against the liege via the regular factions (Court, Prosperity, Glory, Tradition) will now disable any non-aggression pact held with them.
Fixed duchy adventurers from sometimes ending up with an improper government type after usurping the titles.
The Pagan County Conquest CB now allows the ruler to usurp baronies in the target county held by rulers who are neither his culture nor religion, and the tooltip will properly display that.
Fixed Kharijite Rebellion event so the revolt doesn't invalidate.
Fixed liberation revolts so existing rulers may now actually join the rebel leader if he is landless.
'Invite Priest to Court' decision now starts the new character off as a monk, nun, perfecti, desert father, or desert mother (depending on the religion) and thus eligible to be a Lord Spiritual. It also has a 50% chance of creating a woman, if the religion allows female temple holders.
History for c_znojmo changed to reflect the fact it's in de jure d_moravia.
Added description for Urglaube.
Using the customization decision to immediately create the Schism will no longer replace the Pope/Patriarch with new characters, if they already exist.
An Orthodox priest who is granted Constantinople by an Orthodox emperor will now usurp the Ecumenical Patriarch title, if it is still valid.

4.03.0

MAJOR: updated to the CK2 2.5.2 patch.
MAJOR: coalition/infamy mechanics are now used -- we are currently employing vanilla settings for this, and would appreciate feedback on how it works.
Most non-feminist religions now disallow matrilineal marriages by default, unless the ruler has at least Agnatic-Cognatic succession law (at which point matrilineal marriage is activated). Remember that, even if you have matrilineal marriage allowed, your target must also have it allowed in order for a matrilineal marriage to be agreed to.
Muslims now may pass non-agnatic succession laws if they wish, though the AI will not do so.
Iceland no longer starts settled in earlier bookmarks. It must first be discovered and settled by the random events narrating the process. The millenium bookmark and later are unaffected by this.
d_songhay is actually playable in 1060-1080 date range now
Combat trait advancement for children now accounts for education changes in the Conclave DLC:: rowdy children, or children using the Martial education focus or Struggle childhood focus, now gain combat trait levels more quickly.
Automatic title distribution no longer requires your marshal to do but instead uses title decisions to raise/lower your banner. See in-game for more details.
For the EU4C, Albanian and Anglo-Norse cultures should now properly convert
For the EU4C, Eger should now properly convert from the correct CK2 province
Fixed names in South Slavic group to be more authentic
Fixed two Opole/Oppeln counties
Fixed being unable to chage to Enatic-Cognatic succession
Fixed Harald Hardrada being unable to abolish the Witan
Expanded restrictions on provincial culture conversion to all religious titles which use papal succession mechanics.
The Heritage focus may now ONLY be used if the child's educator is either not their culture or religion (since changing it is all the focus does).
When using the 'Ask Permission for Heritage Focus' diplo-decision, the child's liege no longer automatically accepts unless you hold a favor on them (in which case the favor is used).
The chances of the Heritage focus successfully changing culture and/or religion have been decreased.
Fixed the Khorammdin Rebellion so same-culture/same-religion vassals of the caliph can actually join Babak's rebellion.
Prestige/Piety requirements for creating the Patriarch Supreme have been increased.

4.02.1

Restored the War of Two Eriks.
Made councillors vote according to their faction's interests, provided their own interests don't supercede.
Factions now want a member on the council, not just a member in one of the councillor jobs.
The Feudal Elective faction now once again requires Autonomous Vassals CA in order to form.
The AI will no longer start claim wars or claimant revolts for titles that are currently contested in another war.
The AI will only abandon a close-relation NAP for their claim if they dislike you enough to be eligible to form a claimant faction for it.
Halved the prestige gain from all minor titles.
It should be possible now for non-crownlaw titles to pass Title Revocation & Administration laws.
NWO should no longer sometimes generate children for children
NWO should properly generate a Catholic pope and an Orthodox patriarch when selecting the "Schismatic Christians" option
Ambitions to become a councillor no longer apply if the ruler already has an advisor title.
Lowered the Piety requirement for coronation from 100 to 25.
Faction leaders can no longer propose an ultimatum or revolt at a faction meeting if their liege has a liege who has declared Realm Peace, and thus they cannot actually revolt.
Council AI will now take into consideration the target's crime when voting on imprisonment, banishment, or execution.
The AI will now use a wider range of jobs for its councillors.
Councillors now can only be given one job every six months, same as in vanilla. This will also prevent player councillors from being spammed with job requests.
Strength of province-based revolts has been reduced by 20% across the board (since opinions are now lower, and thus levy size is harder to increase).
'Suppress Revolts' action for marshals has had its revolt risk reduction increase from 2% to 5%, and the arrest chance modifier from 5% to 10%.
There is now a random event for the 'Suppress Revolt' job when the marshal is stationed in a province not of his liege's culture/religion or with a province modifier which add significant revolt risk that he will get into a battle with peasant rabble, and either anger or cow the population as a result (affecting revolt risk for five years).
The "In Hiding" trait no longer disallows rulers from serving as councillors.
Updated tributary-renewal events to only apply to the suzerain's death (since tributes are automatically renewed now when the tribute dies).
Fixed bug that would make some reformed pagan religion head titles be made primary even over higher-tier titles upon save.
The AI should now actually change succession laws on occasion, as intended.
Succession laws which were only unlocked with Late Feudal Adminstration now are also unlocked at a certain level of Crown Authority, as well.
Fixed bug in a vanilla event that would cause a man to impregnate himself via an event with the "Way of Life" DLC disabled
Lowered # of powerful vassals which demand a seat on the council by 1 (owing to the fact that Spymasters and Lord Spirituals are more restricted in CK2Plus as to who can hold the title).
The Byzantium reclamation event will now also fire for someone of emperor-tier if their primary title is titular.
Fixed create_provincia_britannia so that it adds d_oxford and d_powys to actually be de Jure k_britannia.
Added an event which should spawn in norse duchy adventurers on occasion between the start of the Viking Age and 1000 AD.
Adolescent romance events can now only happen once per character.
Reduced chance of the AI selecting the Homosexual outcome with the adolescent romance events.
Reduced frequency of mercenaries eloping with daughters and dueling with sons.
Increased base chance of the martyr trait being acquired when killed by heathens from 10% to 25%.
Fixed pentarch alignments of roman provincias.

4.02

MAJOR: Compatibility with the 2.5.1.1 patch and the Conclave DLC. Most major new features should work as well as they do in vanilla (which is to say that they are fairly buggy at this point). Some major points of difference:
- The Infamy/Coalition feature is completely turned off, even if you have the DLC active.
- Shattered Retreats are active, but the distance of the retreat and the speed at which the armies moves during retreat is reduced. They regain morale at normal rather than accelerated rate.
- "Crown Authority" is retained, and works pretty much as it always did.
- Added a "Late Feudal Administration" law, which serves as a prerequisite for some succession types (such as Primogeniture).
- "Status of Women" law is not included, until such a time as we can figure out a better implementation.
- Only one of the new ambitions ("Build a War Chest") is available if you have the DLC active. None of the old ambitions have been removed, whether the DLC is active or not.
- Council voting is not yet optimized for the mod, and pretty much uses vanilla parameters at this point until we figure it out.
- Some of the new events are simply not active (like the horse chancellor), while others have been heavily tweaked. They will likely require more tweaking.
- The new child education focuses and events are untouched and currently completely vanilla.
- Non-Aggression Pacts are cancelled by rivalries and any opinion modifiers which would be considered a crime (held by either party).
- Non-Aggression Pacts which exist solely due to blood (so not through marriage or voluntary agreement) may be cancelled by the AI if they have a usable claim against you or you are their liege and they dislike you enough.
- We would very much like to hear about bugs in 4.02, just remember that what you're seeing may be vanilla functionality and there's very little we can do to affect it. You may also find some weirdness with regards to the new Non-Aggression Pacts affecting how mod events are supposed to play out (in particular factions, since having a Non-Aggression Pact means you're locked out of the four interest factions -- that's hard-coded and we can't get around it, currently). We've tried to anticipate everything we can, but there's no way for us to foresee how all the systems will interact this early on, so more eyes are always better.
Ransomed adventurers should now be properly imprisoned by their ransomer.
Fixed the event text on the event which grants the administrator trait.
The zealots raised by "Build Zeal" now remain if you are in a war with a primary attacker/defender of a different religion group or a heresy/parent of your own religion, not just for certain CB's.
Religious/Heretic rebel uprisings now target the duchy of the province they began in, taking all same-religion provinces therein if they succeed (in addition to any provinces they occupy), rather than taking all same-religion provinces in the entire realm.
The Grand Trunk Road trade network has been added to the Indian sub-continent
German Empire should now be createable when the Supreme Patriarch is in Constantinople.
Some Tamazight events and mechanics have been added.
Roman provincia kingdoms may now be properly formed after they have been de jure established.
Added a plot to elope with your unlanded female lover. Those who stand to inherit are more difficult to elope with.
Changed so that the WoL foci will also lower one stat along with granting their normal bonuses
Prevented a ruler from defending their capital when they are in fact in someone's dungeon and thus unable to defend their capital

4.01.8

Implemented a 'Taifa Vassals' demesne laws for muslim kings and emperors in Iberia, which will make their vassals more prone to want independence until the laws are changed.
All Chalcedonian priests may now not marry. The system whereby priests with Greek Rites could retain their spouse was simply too buggy.
English CoA's will now be set to their proper version upon loading a save (it may be wrong in the title screen, but will set properly upon entering the game). This will not retroactively fix old saves with this issue.
Updated Roman/Byzantine province-creation events to be decisions instead, so you can see the requirements before the province is created. You will see decisions for each province once your realm has any counties in or neighboring the province's region.
Added maintenance event to ensure some religion head titles with papal-type succession don't change their succession type.
Non-Christian fathers who denounce their illegitimate children will now be properly removed as the child's father.
Assyrian culture and history added
Added a "Become a Saint" ambition for Christians -- this will kick off a series of events which can take many years to appear/complete, requiring you to overcome your sins in order to build up a reputation as a Paragon of virtue. It gives you the Paragon trait upon completion (if you manage to complete it), which gives you a chance at true sainthood (aside from the benefits of the trait itself) upon your death. Those who have already acquired the Paragon trait through the "Become a Paragon of Virtue" ambition cannot then take this (or vice-versa). Really this is a means to achieve Paragon status without requiring large amounts of Piety alone, and is available to non-rulers. The ambition is visible when you have 100 Piety or more.
Fixed nomad event where a clan decides to join a departing brother but sometimes will not actually switch liege.
The event granting the crusade kingdom to a relative now gives preference to closer kin, and will only have an option for more distant kin if nobody closer is appropriate.
Renamed the Carolingian Reconquest CB so as not to be confused with the Roman Empire's Imperial Reconquest.
Papal Investiture now extends to all religions which use the papal succession system.
Added Meccan as a pagan religion for Arabs, Tamazight as a pagan religion for Berbers, and Canaanite as a pagan religion for Israelites. All are currently just very basic with no extra events associated.
Added Meccan, Tamazight, and Canaanite religions to NWO's Ancient Religion start option
Updated papal regnal names to be more medieval.
Tributes who are not independent or who have non-independent suzerains will now have their tribute status removed at the annual maintenance sweep.
Patricians are now no longer allowed to join factions unless they are landed.
Upon William the Conqueror's or Harald's victory over England, Saxon realm characters with strong claims on England will have their claim reduced to weak, and those with weak claims will lose them entirely.

4.01.7

Fixed claimant adventurers being able to send the target of their adventure a letter asking for support. Very cheeky of them, no?
Fixed succession law factions so that, if the liege agrees to the ultimatum, the law on the title is actually changed.
Fixed some localisation errors in events related to the succession law factions.
Fixed Carolingian Imperial Reconquest wars from immediately invalidating.
Added a Norman event chain for Rollo to invade or seize control of the Neustrian coast, and perhaps convert or eventually be subjugated.
Added a Norman melting pot event chain (for Norse rulers with French provinces and vice versa).
Seduction is now always limited by distance to the target, whether they're both in the same realm or not.
Fixed liberation revolts from sometimes ending in revolting rulers going independent from their former liege.
Upped lower-end prerequisites for sainthood, to make them less commonplace.
New saints only add to a religion's MA if it's below 75%.
Faction system revolts of rulers who are themselves vassals will no longer be invalidated.
Merchant Republics overthrown by a regular faction will now always abdicate -- their title is never usurped.
Religion heads who are theocracies and for whom the religion head title is their primary now lose all claims upon inheriting the title.
Nationalist revolts now do not apply if the de jure kingdom title of the province where the revolt occurs has a holder in the same realm who is of the province's culture (regardless of whether the top liege does not).
Claim All CB can now also include weak claims if they are usable when the CB is used.
Extended the "6 German Duchies" requirement for HRE formation to include de jure Bavaria and Saxony, in case those were not included in the Carolingian Empire.
If the claimant of a claimant faction is a player, and the title is in their realm, the faction leader will support the player and ask permission. If the player agrees, the faction continues to exist -- but they will not be able to declare support for their liege should the faction rebel, even though they also do not have to support the revolt. If the player refuses, the faction dissolves, and a claimant faction will never form around them again.
The regular factions will now be more difficult to keep happy.
Added a "Reconquista" CB for independent Christian rulers in Iberia targeting Muslim titles in Iberia -- it works like the Holy War CB, but with no Piety cost and no cooldown.
Rulers who should no longer have the Uncrowned/Crowned/Crowned by Pope trait upon a title being usurped should now lose it immediately.
Nationalist revolts no longer rise up against a top liege who is the religion head of the province's religion, regardless of culture.
Ruler claimants can no longer join a claimant faction revolting on his/her behalf if he/she is currently fighting in a war alongside their liege.
Christian & Jewish AI rulers will no longer declare war on their rightful religious head unless they are cynical, excommunicated, or crazy.
The events for re-establishing tributary status will no longer fire for the heir if they are also the new suzerain or tribute.
Added formation rules and crusade weights to k_mongolia and k_khotan.
Removed mongol_tribute triggered modifier.
Fixed "wife suggests councillor" event chains which didn't properly reduce your wife's opinion if you refuse.
Players can no longer join more than one faction at a time, save for when they are invited prior to a civil war starting.

4.01.6

The new CB's added since the HL expansion have been updated to provide success for the 'Win a War' ambition, and to properly adjust Glory faction opinions.
Fixed major river crossings that weren't updated when the Rhine was moved back to its original vanilla placement on the map.
The events adding and removing the Restless Sidhe modifier have been moved to the notification box, similar to general province prosperity events.
The event for improving the combat traits of children now fires much less often if the ward already has a higher level combat trait than the guardian does.
Fixed votes to remove a faction leader so that the faction leader votes against his removal, rather than for.
Fixed "building destroyed" siege event so it should no longer have the chance to destroy a building in the besieger's capital.
Made Cyprus its own de jure kingdom, to prevent Greece from being considered "adjacent" to the Levant for jihad purposes.
Removed vanilla Honest trait event chain which had no localisation.
Lowered the multiplier on the AI's evaluation of marriage Prestige Effects.
Capital of Roman province k_pontus moved to Sinope.
The first leader for many holy orders will no longer have no traits.
Claimant adventurers will now start with a title, rather than gaining one only when they begin the war. The difference this makes is that their target can plot against them without them constantly moving to different courts. They still "travel" around, approaching different rulers for support -- the difference is that they now do this solely by event, rather than by actually moving to the ruler's court. The claimant adventurer loses the title should they ever gain a different one, or if they should otherwise abandon the adventure. It cannot be inherited, even if the claim war has begun.
Vassals can only use the holy war cb against targets bordering/near their demesne provinces (or the demesne provinces of their own vassals), not any province in their liege's realm.
Paulicians are no longer eligible targets for excommunication events.
Revamped some of the duchy adventurer conditions so their targets make more sense.
AI Rulers of Duke or higher tier will now never marry a lowborn -- period.
Fixed sainthood events AGAIN (previous fix was accidentally reverted).
Moved Jolof Company to its proper capital in Cayor.

4.01.5.1

Fixed invalidation of non-standard faction revolts.

4.01.5

Fixed bug where NWO would produce extra prompts & ignoring selections when using a post-Schism bookmark
Fixed a bug with the "Rebuild Persepolis Decision"
Rebalanced the tax income from trade route buildings.
Fixed the "Replace Regent" plot, so it doesn't show immediate success after enacting it.
Removed the Blessed Virgin as one of the localized god-strings for Paulicians.
Chalcedonian faith no longer receives MA bonuses for holding Rome and/or Constantinople after 50 years of game time.
Sahidic culture now applies to all Christians, rather than just Coptics.
Crusade participants now can only ask for fiefs for relatives who are in their vassals or below.
Added a maintenance event which will re-assign AI vassals in large empires if they've been granted to far-away AI lieges (to prevent some of the border gore which can occur in empires).
Bogomilism will no longer revert to a heresy if it formalizes prior to the Schism occurring.
The Church of St. Bogomil decision can no longer be enacted more than once.
William the Conqueror's post-victory decision now changes England's succession law to Primogeniture, and not just England's duchies.
Minor events such as feasts and hunts can now once again be queued up while another event is ongoing.

4.01.4

MAJOR: All former tax and levy laws are now changed to the demesne law system used by EMF -- namely an Obligations law for each holding type, and a "slider" that allows you to customize whether you'd like to focus on levies or taxes (or strike a balance between the two).
MAJOR: Removed the Shattered World system and replaced it with the New World Order system from HIP (with their kind permission). It includes an Ancient Religions option, as Shattered World did.
MAJOR: Through a long period of work with zijistark over at HIP, we've revamped the faction system to work a bit more seamlessly with less chance of revolts invalidating oddly and leaving former vassals independent. From the player side, the main change that you'll notice now is that these sorts of revolts (anything involving the four main factions, the Claimant faction, or the Independence faction) have a "call to arms" period where your liege's other vassals are invited to join over a period of 30 days. At the end of that period, you'll need to enact a decision to either start the civil war or make the ultimatum to the liege. If the liege refuses an ultimatum, the civil war is started automatically (there is no vote in the faction to determine whether or not to go to war). You'll note that the revolts now have ALL vassals in the unified revolt realm, as opposed to a revolt realm and a number of third-party independent revolter allies. The CB should now also properly display all the possible results of the war.
Venice now playable in all bookmarks.
Fixed Restore Themata System decision to properly increase Crown Authority by only one level.
Patricians without county holdings now have more consistent access to the employment decisions.
The AI will now not create a new dynasty when it is heir or pretender to a title held by a member of their current dynasty.
Banishing a decadent dynasty member when there are no other rulers of your religion will now not result in them remaining in your realm.
Fixed the decadence tooltip to not state that imprisoning a decadent dynasty will mean they don't count towards your decadence trait.
Merchant Republics can no longer seize patrician family palaces through their CB.
The decision to lay a claim on the Byzantine Empire should now be more visible to players, and now solely requires that the emperor not have the Strong Basileus trait.
The Bogomilist religion head is now called an Elder, and is elected by a Council of Advisors filled by five Stroinik/Stroinitsa selected from those with the Perfectum trait.
The Subjugation CB can now be used by non-tribal & non-nomadic rulers against de jure vassals who are either independent or part of the same realm, and who are either both of the same culture group and religion or who have previously become independent through rebellion or after a different rebellion has resulted in them breaking free (these now apply the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion modifier, inherited by heirs for the next 50 years, instead of providing claims to the former liege). It does not require that the Crown Authority of king and empire titles be first raised to Medium or above, as de jure claim wars do. If the target was one who became independent, the CB will not only re-vassalize them but also imprison them (and the 'Broke Vassal Contract' opinion will allow revocation/execution).
When a minor clan rises in a nomad realm, the nomadic ruler will have the opportunity to simply give them the county and let them become a major clan in the realm rather than fight them.
Changed name of Finnish pagan high priest/priestess.
Revamped events for appearance of Genghis Khan -- Genghis will now definitely expand rapidly and not simply sit there with his troops.
Fixed bugs related to the Zoroastrian decision "Make Great Sacrifice"
Doubled the durations of modifiers for the Zoroastrian decision "Make Great Sacrifice"
Fixed late-bookmark rulers for Lietuva and Lithuania
The decision to create the Patriarch Supreme now can only be taken by an Emperor with 1500 Prestige, if it's not being taken by a Pope/Ecumenical Patriarch with sufficient Piety on their own.
The Patriarch Supreme is now also granted the bishopric of Rome by an AI Chalcedonian ruler (with no player as a top liege), just as with the Pope.
Fixed Paulician religion description localisation.
The Paulician religion heads may no longer excommunicate.
Nomads may now absorb tribal holdings held by a vassal chief in a province that is the same culture and religion (this destroys the holding).
Increased the annual chance of the Spy Network rating being increased by a spymaster.
Added some restrictions on where AI religion heads can declare crusades: the target must contain a holy site, have a province of that religion, or the de jure kingdom either contains a count belonging to that religion/one of its provinces neighbors one.
You now have the option of immediately triggering the schism for Christians in any bookmark prior to 1054 on the first day of a new game. This will supplant Chalcedonians with Catholics and Orthodox appropriately. After the first day this option disappears.
Bug fixed that prevented the selection of Novgorod as playable in 1221 and onwards.
The First Academy religion head title may now be properly created by Promethean pagans.
Patricians are no longer able to join independence factions.
Fixed up a few remaining empire-tier titles which weren't updated to requiring either 150 realm size or 50 provinces in order to create them (as opposed to just 150 realm size).
The Indian religious group no longer gets the 'wrong religion capital' modifier if their capital is of a different religion in the Indian group.
Non-merchant republics/patricians that gain a province with a trade post which will push them past the trade post limit of the Trade Practices tech will now result in that trade post being removed.
Fixed the sainthood events so they occur within a shorter timeframe, thus making it far less likely for the delayed event to simply be "lost" by the engine.
The Norse invasions in the Old God bookmark given a bit of a boost.
The "Ask For Embargo" diplomatic action has been disabled (since it does not follow the rules of the CB -- you can ask a liege to use the CB even when he is not valid to do so).
Fixed a bug where women rulers/heirs were sometimes prompted to marry other women.
When the Carolingian Empire is formed, rulers who have to give up lands to the Pope will now receive an event telling them why.
The Charlemagne event where an Ummayad vassal asks for help declaring independence now only fires for a neighboring realm, and the vassal will wait until his ally is not at war to start his own.
Crusades no longer grant the kingdom to the title holder if he is part of the target's realm, even if he is of the crusader's religion.

4.01.3

MAJOR: Nomad rulers with 25+ realm provinces and 4+ demesne provinces who die with at least two adult, capable sons will now split the clan between them (amongst up to four sons, depending on the realm size). The sons not inheriting the main title may choose to split off and become independant, and neighboring clans may choose to join them. To reduce border gore, provinces which are not connected by land to either the realm capital or the capital of a nomadic vassal will be usurped by one of the sons who has a neighboring province.
MAJOR: Added new factions for Seniority, Primogeniture, Gavelkind, and Feudal Elective succession. The factions work much the same as in vanilla, except -- if the liege refuses the ultimatum -- the rebellion itself works the same as the general faction rebellions, with individual vassals being called to join in. The factions themselves will only appear under certain conditions: if the culture is appropriate for the succession type, if the title previously had that succession law, or if the heir under that law is particularly ambitious and capable.
Empires now require only 2 King titles to form, instead of 3.
Kingdoms now require only 2 Duchy titles to form, instead of 3.
To form an empire now requires the holder to have either 150 realm holdings OR 50 realm provinces. Maintaining the empire requires either 100 realm holdings OR 35 realm provinces.
Nomad realms may now have up to 12 clans, and the ideal size for each clan has been reduced slightly.
Nomad rebellions won't be started by the AI for the first two years of the game, like the other rebellions.
Forts are now free, but take 60 days to build (instead of 20) and have a much smaller garrison.
Empty provinces now require 50 soldiers to occupy (instead of 100).
If a new nomadic khagan is of a different dynasty than the last one, there is a chance that their clans will decide to split off on their own (the chance is based on their clan opinion of you, as well as your relative power to each other, in addition to their personal traits). If they split off, you will get a strong but not inheritable claim on all their counties.
Tributaries are automatically inherited if a ruler abdicates or his title is passed off to another after a succession crisis.
Extra daughters for early bookmarks now appear at the start again (instead of after one day) and still have randomized traits.
The Shattered Realm decision will no longer make bunch of clone characters. After all decisions have been made the game must be run at speed 1 for exactly one day, then paused to allow the game to catch up on generating the characters.
Tweaked the initial distribution of duel engine combat traits to include martially-educated courtiers as well as landed rulers.
Battlefield duels should now more consistently impact the morale balance of the battle.
Fixed the Settle Province job action for nomadic stewards.
Winter supply reductions have been halved, to match the halving of the base supply limit.
Players will no longer be included in the "extra daughters for early bookmarks" function.
The "Saint" and "Martyr" nicknames will no longer be gained except on death, through the sainthood system.
The "Recent Uprising" province modifier added by Peasant, Decadence, and Minor Clan revolts now lasts 10 years instead of 5.
Religious, Heretic, and Liberation revolts now give you the option of dealing with the province where they originated, once the war is over. You can "teach them a lesson", giving you +1 tyranny and adding a harsh penalty to taxea and levies for five years but extending the "Recent Uprising" modifier to ten years and giving a 25% chance of converting religion/culture (depending on the uprising type), "force them to convert" which gives you +2 tyranny and harsher penalties, but the "Recent Uprising" modifier lasts twenty years and there is a 50% chance of conversion, or you can opt to find a more peaceful solution (ie. do nothing).
Trade network roads now increase movement speed of armies dependant on rank
Patricians without county holdings should now be able to join factions.
Fixed the province of Oland.
For the EU4 Converter, fixed a bug that prevented the loading of National Idea localization
Fixed a number of instances, such as with the schisms, where the effects would ignore characters/provinces in rebelling realms.
Fixed Bogomilist rulers bouncing back and forth between different religion organization laws, losing Piety each time.
Fixed mixed up Shekinah choices localisation.
Pretender factions now cannot support a claimant of a different realm unless the claimant is not a ruler or the claimed title's holder is independent.
The ruler of Poland-Lithuania is now called 'King' even though it remains an Empire-tier title.
The Shiite Caliphate revolt has been made more likely to happen, and if the Imamah should vanish then the Fatimid dynasty head can step forward and assume the title.
Incorporated new Coptic dynasty names helpfully supplied by user Polskers.
The AI will no longer use some CB's on non-neighboring targets unless they have at least the first level of naval tech available.
The "rule in peace for 10 years" ambition now works for vassals, as well.
Viking adventurers (including raiding adventurers) will no longer appear until the Viking Age actually begins.
Trade Network values have been tweaked. The base wealth of all trade networks, except for the African Trade and Silk Road, has been massively reduced. In exchange the contribution from buildings in trade posts in those networks has been greatly increased, especially from trade guilds.
Vassal limit for emperors raised slightly (multiplier raised from 15 to 20).
Asking for excommunication cost raised (now costs 100 Wealth and 250 Piety).
The barony of Wallingford has been moved from Oxford to Berkshire.
Imprisoning an adventurer will now actually end their adventure (so banishing them doesn't mean they'll simply continue their attempt).
Adventurers now will never attempt a second adventure in their lifetime, should they fail the first.
Fixed an issue where killing a kidnap victim sometimes didn't result in them actually dying.
Fixed name issue with Michael I of Byzantium.
Cleaned up some duplicate character history entries for rulers in Armenia Minor and Antioch.
Fixed two rulers in the New Millenium bookmark who were beginning as theocracies but shouldn't have been.
Non-feudal AI vassals who gain a kingdom as a result of a crusade will never keep the kingdom for themselves.

4.01.2

MAJOR: New Millenium bookmark re-added (and also fixed and reworked).
MAJOR: Tributes are no longer automatically ended when one of the rulers dies. If the suzerain dies, all tributes receive an event a day later asking if they wish to pay tribute to his heir. If they do, the new suzerain receives and event (and can refuse, setting them free). If they decline, the heir receives an event and can let them go or start an immediate war to reclaim them. If the tribute dies, his heir receives an event and is presented with the same choice: pay tribute to the suzerain or decline and possibly face invasion. NOTE: The same is NOT the case when the title of either ruler changes hands in any other way than death -- usurpation or the like will automatically end the tribute.
Updated for the 2.4.5 Beta
Byzantine Subjugation CB now requires a CA of Medium or higher. It also now targets a de jure duchy, and if the holder of the duchy (or counties within the duchy, if the duchy has no holder) has no counties outside of the needed regions they will be vassalized. If they do hold counties outside the region, or are Emperor-tier, the duchy will be usurped instead.
Removed the change to the Rhine, moving it back to its original vanilla location (to free up mod space).
Fixed Afghan, Baloch, and Sogdian retinues.
Fixed up the event chains for Seljuk, Timur, and Sabuktigin to appear. Seljuk in particular is likely to first appear as a nomad adventurer, though he will quickly settle if he takes feudal territory.
Fixed Enforce Chalcedon and Enforce Ephesus decisions so they can actually be used by Nestorians and Miaphysites, respectively.
Made Edward the Confessor once more "Eadward".
Bulgarian provinces in the Charlemagne bookmark have been made Bolghar. They now convert to Bulgarian through event, and a 'Embrace Bulgarian Culture' conversion decision has been added.
Avar provinces in Wallachia in the Charlemagne bookmark have been changed to Vlach culture.
Nomad set-up has been altered so they now have the temple holdings which should be present in their provinces, and provinces which should have a different culture/religion will be maintained. This means that some provinces have tribal holdings, and cannot be destroyed via Pillage Holding until and unless the culture and religion of the province matches the nomad ruler.
Randomly-generated AI daughters are now more varied -- but they appear after 1 day, instead of immediately at game start.
Many of the opinion modifiers which allowed execution now also allow banishment.
The Army of Lucifer is no longer active at game start.
Forces/forts are no longer required to maintain an empty province as occupied.
Once the Patriarch Supreme is appointed, all new priests will take his rite, and any challenges he makes to existing priests' rites will not lower Chalcedonian MA.
Fixed kharijite execution decision to not make the executioner a kinslayer unless warranted.
Pechenegs are now nomadic in the Old Gods bookmark and tribal in the later bookmarks.
Added a tooltip to make it easier to understand when you can't pillage the last non-nomadic holding in a province that isn't of your culture and religion.
Removed the fixes to uncle/aunt/cousin opinions (as they were likely what was causing the flags to go awry on reload).
Replaced the blue blindfold with the one from CPRplus thanks to the courteous permission of sifsilver and the CPRplus team.
The AI will no longer form or join pretender factions for titles held by rulers outside of their own realm, unless they are independent.

4.01.1

MAJOR: A system for martyrs and saints added. A non-heretic Christian character may be declared a martyr if they die facing infidels in battle during a holy war or a crusade, or if they are executed by an infidel. Upon death, a character may also be considered for sainthood provided they have very high Piety (2000 Piety or 1000 Piety if also combined with Celibate, Theologian, Crusader, Voice of Jesus, True Christian Knight or is a Theocracy -- non-rulers have lower Piety requirements, however) or some other qualification that bypasses the Piety check (such as a Paragon, Martyr, a religion head, someone who mended the schism, a king who was converted to Christianity or the bishop who converted them) and no other traits that would disqualify them -- if they are declared a saint, their portrait changes and their heirs receive Piety.
Supply limits upped slightly, and maximum attrition levels applied for the winter effects.
Fixed being unable to build some trade post buildings.
Fixed income gain from Toll Booths and Customs Houses.
Re-localized Zikri back to its original name.
Added spouse/consort conversion decision for Chalcedonian.
The Paulician Patriarch no longer inherits the Antioch Patriarchate if they are not a theocracy.
Religion head titles which are inherited/usurped, but belong to a different religion, are now either reverted back to their previous owner (if they're alive) or destroyed.
Ineligible courtiers of the player will no longer get married.
Added age customization traits for the Ruler Designer -- select them to reduce your starting age by a set amount, and they disappear once the game begins.
If using the Ruler Designer, you can now select a "Customize Ruler Dynasty" trait, which will allow you to assign an existing character as a relative and assume their dynasty (only if you don't select the Bastard trait, however, in which case you keep your Ruler Designer dynasty but still get the relatives). This is only useable in the first 15 days of the game.
The events which destroy Byzantium/HRE/Latin Empire due to having the wrong religion now create a custom empire title to replace it if you aren't eligible for the normal one, if no empire has been based on the kingdom of your capital already, and so long as you have a proper realm size to support it. The vassals which could possibly go independent as a result will only be those who are also de jure vassals of the destroyed title.
Lombardy now has the vanilla flag rather than Italy's flag.
Italy now has the proper title history for Lombardy in the Old Gods start and later.
Made the AI slightly more aggressive.
The Chalcedonian Pope is now more likely to pick cardinals closer to home.
Duchy adventurers given a set of logical preferences regarding what their target realms will be, and seafaring adventurers are restricted to targets within their logical "sea range".
Raiding adventurers will now properly recruit more soldiers with any money they've gained (vanilla bug fixed).
Raiding adventurers will not raid their former liege or any of his vassals for at least five years, if he liked the liege at all.
Fixed pillage settlement decision to properly apply the effects (vanilla bug fixed).
Nomads may now only abandon provinces which have no settlements (vanilla bug fixed).
The Byzantine Empire may now be formed by Chalcedonians.
The Paulician Patriarch no longer grants divorces.
Fixed the "Rule For 20 Years" ambition so it won't cancel if you're not independent.
Religion heads will excommunicate anyone of the same religion, if attacked (provided they can).
Attacking a religion head will also prompt rulers to offer support -- sometimes joining their war, sometimes offering coin and volunteers.
Catholic/Orthodox holy orders will resume their normal religions after the schism, if they've been formed.
Waldensian sacking events now won't single out Koln, Canterbury, and Santiago as holy sites prior to the schism.
Added a CB which may be used by non-nomads to take any bordering county held by a nomad.
Religious and Heretic rebels will now always usurp all provinces of their religion from the top liege, in addition to any occupied provinces.
Decadence rebels will now always usurp the province they revolted in, in addition to any occupied provinces. They will also take the top liege prisoner.
Tribals may use an Establish Tribe decision in a province with no settlements, costing 100 Prestige and immediately building a tribe settlement in the capital slot.
Rulers who are neither tribal nor nomadic may use an Establish Castle decision in a province with no settlements, costing 100 Wealth and immediately building a castle settlement in the capital slot.
Hungary's establishment by the magyars now allows the k_hungary title to be subsequently usurpred and/or re-created.
Reduced the amount of taxes nomads get from Population.
Reduced the amount of max Population increased for nomads for each empty province.
Nomads no longer get to call the full levy of their non-nomadic vassals without regard for their opinion.
Fixed Anglo-Norse not receiving a cultural building.
Tribal invasions can only be performed against a target kingdom when they own at least one county in the kingdom or a neighbouring province.
Empty nomad provinces which are conquered but which don't have the same culture as the attacker will automatically build a tribal holding (and thus retain their previous culture).
Nomads can now only destroy the last holding in a province when the province is of their own culture.
Nomad stewards may now use the Settle Province job action to more quickly change a province's culture.
Both tribal invasions and nomad invasions (the ones which target Kingdom titles) now require 500 Prestige to use.
Paulician and Kharijite crusades against same-religion group targets will no longer invalidate.
Byzantine Emperors with the Strong Basileus trait are now able to subjugate lower tier independent rulers who are of their own religion group (but not a parent religion or a heresy) and who have a capital that lies within the Greece, Nicaea, Armenia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Trebizond, Sicily, Syria or Jerusalem regions. If the target enforces a loss on the emperor, the Strong Basileus trait is forfeit.
Added a "Prove Your Rule" decision for a Byzantine emperor with the Coronated Basileus trait to gain the Strong Basileus trait instead.
Dishonorable trait levels now add a -5 opinion malus per level instead of -10.
Dishonorable trait levels can only be acquired through sieging up to level 5, and only if killing courtiers of a holder who is of your own religion.
The Schemer lifestyle trait now adds a +25% plot power bonus as well.
Pentarchy cities (such as Rome) are not restored to their traditional religion head by the AI if their top liege is a player.
Fixed up some remaining characters and provinces which were still Chalcedonian in the 1066 bookmark.
Duel Engine changes:
-Instead of automatically being maimed, characters who take wounds while already wounded will lose some health. Any health lost this way will be regained over time after the battle (assuming the character lives long enough to recover). There remains a small chance of being maimed or made incapable by taking hits in duels.
-Characters made incapable during a duel will automatically yield. Opponents may then choose what to do with them (kill them, take them captive, or, for battlefield duels, just leave them there.
-AI characters that lose a round are inceasingly likely to yield as the fight goes on and/or as they lose more and more health.
-Martial score no longer directly affects the outcome of duels, it is now primarily driven by personal combat skill, personal combat traits, and other relevant traits. Martial education traits still have a small effect.
-The events concluding holmgangs should no longer fire twice.

4.0.1

Fixed formation of the Carolingian Empire to refer to k_lombardy rather than k_italy, and now actually requires control of Bavaria.
Added Chalcedonian support to the EU4 converter
Monophysites, Nestorians and Massalians should now properly convert in the EU4 converter
Naturally-born children should no longer think their father is their uncle.
Feudal pagans will no longer have their succession type revert to gavelkind if they change it.
Forming the Holy Roman Empire now requires 6 East Francia duchies to either be held by a vassal or majority-controlled -- not completely controlled.
Forming the Holy Roman Empire early (prior to Carolingian Empire being formed) may now be done by anyone who's not a Karling and whose religion head is the Pope, and the requirements are easier to see.
Control of Saxony is no longer required to form the Carolingian Empire, though the AI won't do it unless Saxony is out of their reach.
Charlemagne won't start the Saxony Wars unless he can actually use the Claim CB against the Saxon king.
Customs Houses, Toll Booths and Trade Guild Headquarters (for trade posts) should now properly apply their tax income boost via a province modifier.
Nomads and Tribals may no longer build the trade post buildings outside of the Silk Road buildings.
Bug fixed that prevented the building of a Trade Guild HQ
The Chalcedonian Pope in Rome now appoints Cardinals, and is succeeded by one of them. They do not elect the Pope, however, and the succession cannot be influenced.

4.0

NOTE: You may experience a longer-than-normal delay as you start the game (after selecting a character), depending on your computer's processing power. This is expected.
MAJOR: The two earliest bookmarks have merged both Catholic and Orthodox into a single Chalcedonian Christianity. The Latin Pope and the Ecumenical Patriarch rule as members of the pentarchy over their respect territories, while other kings and emperors will have autocephalous patriarchs. Events will occur that can anger the two sides and drive them further apart (such as the crowning of a Holy Roman Emperor by the Pope), and once their anger reaches a certain point the Great Schism will occur and Chalcedonians will split up into Catholic and Orthodox based on their current religion head, cultures, and top liege's choice. The Schism can be stopped if a Supreme Patriarch is anointed (meaning an actual Chalcedonian religion head, since none exists to begin), if Rome is not held by a bishop following the Latin Rites, or if Constantinople is not held by a bishop following the Greek Rites.
Fixed province issue with Tyrnovo.
Fixed typo in themata event.
Restricted the Celtic Uchelwr and Laoch honorary titles by culture (as they are basically identical otherwise).
Celtic Court Druid minor title removed, merged into Seer councillor job (localized as Court Druid for feudal/republican Celtic pagans).
Invite Druid to Court decision removed, Invite Holy Man decision now generates druids when used by Celtic pagans.
Celtic coming of age event can now fire for daughters as well as sons.
Celtic characters now have a chance of gaining a level of Headhunter trait for killing opponents in battlefield duels. (This chance will be higher for more difficult opponents.)
All holy orders now have the same one donation limit per donator's lifetime.
Fixed bug making Kingdom of Al-Andalus uncreatable.
Fixed opinions of sons to fathers at game start, also fixed opinions with cousins/aunts/uncles/nephews/nieces.
AI religion heads will no longer personally lead armies during a crusade.
There is now a decision to become the Paulician Patriarch -- unlike other Christian religion heads, this one can be held by a feudal ruler. The Patriarch in the 867 bookmark is now playable.
Pagans now have access to all other succession types once they stop being tribal, even if their religion hasn't reformed.
Successful rebels who were heavily-reinforced during their rebellion should no longer have large amounts of event troops sticking around forever.
The Byzantine Emperor may freely revoke the county of Constantinople or the bishopric of Constantinople (if the holder is a different religion) from a vassal without ill effect.
The AI should be much less willing to marry lowborn commoners.
Forming the Carolingian Empire now requires control of Lombardy as well.
The "courtier asks your permission to duel a rival" event should now identify the intended target.
There should now be more available eligible brides in the beginning of the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks.
Theocracies, mercenaries, and holy orders will no longer form cadet dynasties.
The 'Fabricate a Claim' plot can now be used against allies (though the AI won't do it).
Individual claim CB's will now still show up even if you have multiple strong claims.
Added the new traits from VIET into the main mod.

3.11.3

MAJOR: Muslim Decadence system has been completely changed:
- Decadence value is completely removed. Muslim empires now use Imperial Decadence.
- The 'Decadent' trait still exists for individual Muslims. The number of Decadent dynasty members in the dynasty head's realm (meaning they are their vassal or lower) will potentially give them a 'decadent dynasty' trait which has three levels, and affects their piety and Muslim opinion. Decadent relatives in their realm can be 'straightened up' as before, and if they ultimately refuse they may be exiled (instead of imprisoned/executed).
- Exiled decadent characters are more prone to becoming adventurers.
- Decadent characters will tend to ask for titles, estates, and coin -- and get upset if they don't receive it. They like to plot.
- The Decadent trait itself will have more effects on the individual character, making for a bad ruler if they ever get into power.
- Muslims who are not in the same realm as their dynasty head (meaning their dynasty head is not their immediate liege or higher) will tend to form a new cadet dynasty.
- Most events which previously raised or lowered decadence will now affect Piety instead.
MAJOR: Spy Networks have been added:
- You increase the value of your Spy Network by using the 'Build Spy Network' Spymaster job
- Building the network also builds your Spymaster's own Spy Network rating -- make sure you trust them
- Spy Network can be expended on modifiers (lasting a year) which increase plot power, plot discovery chance, and speed up the chance of plots succeeding
- You may also spend Spy Network, as well as coin, to hire an assassin to immediately try and kill anyone you've targeted with a murder plot
- Spy Network on its own increases the time it takes for plots to succeed against you
- You can expend Spy Network to try and 'Dismantle Spy Network' (a diplo-action), which might reduce the target's Spy Network rating (but can also reveal you)
- The current value of your Spy Network is visible in the description of the 'Activate Spy Network' decision
MAJOR: The results of changing from tribal to feudal/republic has changed. You still only need a fully-upgraded capital holding and Absolute Tribal Organization, but ONLY your tribal holdings that have also been upgraded will convert to a castle or temple. There's a warning tooltip to tell you which holdings will not convert, as well as to warn you when you have non-converting tribal holdings in a province not of your culture (as these receive the 'wrong government type' malus) as well as which tribal vassals are not of your culture (as they receive an opinion malus towards you).
MAJOR: After upgrading a tribal holding to a castle/city, for the next 100 years you will still receive events from your Steward prompting you to build a city, and pious courtiers will still approach you asking for help in building a temple (in fact, the chances of both those things will be higher). You also have the option during that time of forcing the issue with title decisions on the county: 'Build First City' and 'Build First Temple'. They both require 100 gold, and temple building requires an appropriate courtier, and you can only do one of each at a time.
Republics and Merchant Republics now accept lieges of their own culture (no 'wrong government' malus).
Theocracies now only accept lieges of their own religion.
Tribal governments now only accept theocracy lieges of their own religion.
Children of viceroys will no longer gain strong claims on the viceroy title, and gain a weak claim instead.
The Cathar religion head is now a Patriarch/Matriarch, with a Council of Perfecti that elect him/her. Those on the council are Deacons/Deaconesses, and can be selected from amongst bishops as well as non-ruling Cathar with a religious education trait -- so long as they have the Perfectum trait.
Constantine's Return event for the Byzantine Emperor will have a smaller chance of making him Iconoclast the later it fires.

Removed extra tax bonus off infrastructure technology.
Removed rogue Mauretania kingdom from the 1066 start.
Added some of the new cultures which have appeared since Charlemagne DLC into the Go Pagan events/decisions.
Removed Favored Son minor title and the Raise Worthy Son ambition

3.11.2

Fixed flags so the pagan holy orders can once again appear
Split up Uppland by adding the Duchy of Halsingland
Changed playable pagan religion head titles so they don't break a player who has one as their primary title
Celtic holy orders/mercenaries will no longer switch to tanistry succession
Other holy orders will always switch back to the proper succession if they change somehow.
Sea travel through the Gulf of Kutch and the sea zones north of Iceland should now be possible.

3.11.1

Gave a boost to the Yngling ruling Oppland in the CM start.
The duchy of Alania is now a tributary to Khazaria in the CM start, not a vassal.
Fixed Reformed Germanic Pagan religious head existing prematurely.
Fixed map position for the middle province of the Rhine.
Fixed the Seljuk dynasty tree.
Fixes and Changes for the Kemetic and Atenic religions

- Restored some missing event pictures
- Fixed a bug preventing Atenics from restoring the Priesthood
- Added province modifiers to track the construction of Pyramids and Luxor temple
Expanded the depth of non-Silk Road Trade Networks

x Toll Booth and Customs House: Provides a flat tax income. Depending on the province, and the importance of the land or sea network involved, it may have either or both of these improvements available.
x Trade Guilds: This late game improvement provides large boosts to the trade network itself. Due to their large starting wealth neither the Silk Road, nor African trade may build a guild.
x Roads: This improvement provides a small boost to trade values in a network
Yazidi have been updated as per the Heretic Pride mod. Yazidi now:
- Have a pilgrimage decision to go to the holy site of Lalish
- Have a "Circulate the Peacock" festival instead of a Grand Feast
- Believe in reincarnation
- Young men may be declared koasasa, a reincarnation of one of the Seven Archangels
- The religion head is no longer a caliphate, and always exists
Added cultural localization for tribal titles.
Fixed the vanilla bug where Lord Spirituals of other religions from tribal or nomadic governments had no localization and were thus "Court Chaplain"s
Removed most religious title localization from non-religious titles in favor of cultural localization. (there are a few intentional exceptions).
The "Constantine's Return" Event should no longer spam fire.
Circle of Druids added as an electorate system for the Celtic Archdruid.
Council of Apostles added as an electorate system for the Manichaean Archegos.
Polygamist fathers are no longer barred from being able to legitimize bastards on birth
Updated Celtic Pagans (some additions from the Ancient Religions mod, some bugfixes). Added Red Dragon Knights holy order.

Added the Prometheans and Cult of Titan as heresies for Hellenic Pagans.
The Pontifex Maximus is now a religion head (for Hellenic Pagans) that is held by a priest, not the emperor. He is elected by the College of Pontiffs. A Hellenic emperor does have the ability to force him to abdicate, if he is their vassal.
The Hungarian invasion in the Old Gods start once again settles Hungary upon success, leaving their old lands behind. This works for a non-Horse Lords start, and if the Hungarians are nomads then settling in Hungary via decision will have the same effect (the old lands do not remain nomadic, however -- they revert to tribal).

Plugged a bunch of vanilla "holes" in the India history files, the ones that were mistakes and not simply omissions.
Fixed tooltip for banish to reflect the new vanilla function.
The Grand Duchy of Tuscany can now be formed by Italians as well as Germans.
All titular title which can be formed by Italians can now also be formed by Lombards.

Duel Engine: Reduced chance of battlefield duels to account for lower number of potential commanders in 2.4.
Added Messalian religion head, so the patriarchs will properly display. The Patriarch of Antioch will automatically become the Messalian religion head.
Edited tooltips for Pentarchy to mention that religions which only recognize the Petrine Sees will get three Patriarchs, not five. Added tooltips to those religions.
All provinces which have an uprising will now get the "Recent Uprising" modifier, reducing revolt risk in that province by 100% for five years.

Muslims have a much lower chance of using Holy War against Ibadi, as well as the reverse.
Nomad subjugation now costs prestige to use.

Non-nomadic AI will no longer use the tributary CB against targets of a different religion group.
Unlanded religion heads can no longer call crusades.
The Jewish religion head no longer exists at game start.
Building the Third Temple and restoring the Jewish high priesthood are now one decision -- by building the Third Temple, the Jewish religion gains its religion head. It now requires that a Jewish King or Emperor completely controls Jerusalem, which itself must be Jewish.
Tributary wars can no longer be declared on targets of equal or higher rank.
The Become Exalted ambition now grants an Exalted trait and not a modifier.

3.10

* Updated for the 2.4.3 patch release.
* Titular empire and kingdom titles that are supposed to be invalid with the Charlemagne DLC active are now made inactive instead, so they cannot be seen or even searched for. If you really want to, it is okay to make the DLC inactive and those titles will re-appear during the annual maintenance (as well as the reverse -- any titles which are held will not be made inactive during maintenance).
* Instead of making the "Form New Kingdom" and "Form New Empire" decisions disappear when you hold an invalid primary title, there is now a tooltip that tells you why.
* The "barren" modifier is now only added once a character gets married/becomes a consort, to prevent the AI from magically detecting it first.
* Updated tooltips on kidnap plot event so it doesn't display that you'll be killing yourself.
* Fixed Baloch, Sogdian and Tocharian characters from not getting retinues
* Added Sahidic (Coptic) culture for Egyptians who are also Coptic/Monophysite, using Arabic skin tone and features but eastern-style Christian garb (as well as Christian names for titles and holdings). Egyptian characters/provinces that become Coptic/Monophysite can become Sahidic, as well as the reverse.
* Monks & Nuns will now automatically become divorced when they gain the trait.
* Reduced chance of courtiers electing to become monks & nuns.
* Sons and daughters of estate holders now inherit them according to the liege's gender law.
* Added desert mothers and desert fathers for Coptics/monophysites -- they are wandering ascetic monks/nuns, and while they can become Chancellors or Lord Spirituals (and cannot lead armies), they will eventually move on to another court.
* Antipopes can no longer be targeted by the Accuse Heresy plot.
* Coptics, Apostolics, Nestorians, and Monothelites of high Learning (8+) now have the ability to embrace either the Alexandrine or Antiochian school of theology.
* Reorganized the bookmarks so they're in chronological order again.
* Merged in parts of "High Kings and Consuls"
* Blank event description for relatives requesting to become monks/nuns is fixed.
* Made the arrow indicating blocked trade more easily distinguishable from the unblocked one.
* AI will not fight to reclaim pentarchy temple holdings from patriarchs of the same realm and religion.
* Added Latin Patriarchates (duke-tier titles, same as the pentarchy titles) for Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch should Catholics gain those temples.
* 'Mend the Great Schism' is now useable by Orthodox/Catholics heresies, provided they have a religion head, and also works against heresies, provided they have a religion head. It does not require that the same empire control all five Pentarchy sees, but rather that all the sees belong to the same religion. The user can be the religion head or any Empire that has the religion head as a vassal or owns one of the sees (and must still have sufficient piety, not to mention a religion with 90 MA).
* Once the Schism has been mended, there are now also similar decisions to 'Enforce the Council of Chalcedon' (against the Miaphysite religions) and to 'Enforce the Council of Ephesus' (against Nestorians).
* Nestorians have a decision to 'Repudiate the Council of Ephesus', turning Orthodoxy into a heresy, and may 'Enforce the Council of Chalcedon' once that has been done.
* Miaphysites have a decision to 'Repudiate the Council of Chalcedon', turning Orthodoxy and the other Miaphysite faith into heresies, and may 'Enforce the Council of Ephesus' once that has been done.
* Once Nestorians or Miaphysites have turned Orthodox into a heresy, they may use the 'Unite Christianity' decision against Catholicism in the same manner.
* All the 'mend schism' type decisions have been turned into a chain involving the creation of an ecumenical council, with the results making more sense and resulting in less flip-flopping of parents/heresies afterwards.
* Adjusted decadence gain for muslims.
* Added Journey of Nerthus event chain for Germanic Pagans.
* Added decision to rebuild Irminsul for Germanic Pagans, if it is destroyed by Charlemagne.
* Added expel and donate decisions for Fianna/Gwydion holy orders.

3.09.1

* Stripped out some maintenance calculations and features to lower the memory overhead for the mod. The most noticeable ones from a player side would be the removal of the "isolated from capital" modifiers and the "away from court" character modifier when leading an army.
* Expanded the Trade Network.
- The Silk Road has been expanded
- The following Trade Networks have been added:
x "Amber Road" This land route extends from Novgorod to Venice and Contanstinople
x "Mediterranean Trade" This mostly sea based trade network expands out of Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria and reaches as far as the Straits of Gibraltar
x "Balkan Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Constantinople and covers much of the Balkan
x "Salt Road" This mostly land based trade network expands out of Lubeck and Hamburg and covers most of Germany
x "French Trade" This land based trade network expands from the north of France and streches into Barcelona and Lombardy via Paris
x "Iberian Trade" This land based trade network expands from south western France and Barcelona into the corners of the Iberian sub-continent
x "Atlantic Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the British Isles as well as the French and Iberian coastlines
x "British Trade" This land based zone encompasses Britain from London and Winchester to Fife
x "Baltic Sea Trade" This sea based zone encompasses the Baltic
x "African Trade" This land area encompasses sub-Saharan West Africa and leads into Morocco

- have an event for Bogomil's appearance in Bulgaria, if Tyrnovo has become Orthodox
- feudal rulers may have temple holdings as well as castles
- may use the Consolamentum decision to become Perfecti
- may use the adoption decision, as the Cathar do
- may gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sieging Christian temples
- occasionally spawn missionaries in neighboring non-Bogomilist courts
- are anti-church and anti-feudal at the outset, but may reform their faith through a series of laws and decisions to the point of allowing temple holders to once again be bishops and to have a religion head
- once a religion head is gained, Bogomilism will no longer be an Orthodox heresy but its own religion in the Christian group
- may not have Perfecti in government positions until the religion has been sufficiently reformed
- may build the Church of St. Bogomil once the religion has been sufficiently reformed
* Fixed army movement to Kilkenny.
* Fixed formation of Hungary via the war at the Old Gods start.
* Fixed nomadic Magyars settling in Hungary so it properly gives them the k_hungary title.
* Fixed tribal vassals so they can properly go feudal if under a non-tribal liege.
* Fixed Italian dlc portraits not showing
* Allowed West Africans to raid heathens reguardless of their religion.
* Fixed negative decadence effects.
* Fixed d_galicia not being de jure k_spanish_galicia in the CM and OG starts.
* Changed the disease outbreak chance to match vanilla's.
* Fixed Makedon dynasty in the OG start.
* Opened up a number of minor titles to women based on ability to hold court positions or succession law, as appropriate.
* Fixed bug that was overly narrowing who could be given the Commander title.
* Fixed freezing problem when a nomad tries to settle -- any non-nomad king vassals have their titles usurped, and the duchy of the province being settled in also is usurped if held in the realm.
* Fixed CTD in the "Shattered Realm" decision
* The "Shattered Realm" decision now factors in Nomads properly for all cases
* Fixed unreformed Pagans being unable to feudalise or become republics.
* Norman culture creation events which happen prior to 1150 now happen if the province ruler is Norman or Norse, no matter who their liege is.
* Made Alania tribal at game start rather than nomad.
* De jure changes in Sweden: c_viken moved to d_ostlandet, c_medelpad and c_halsingland moved to d_uplland, d_jamtland moved to k_norway.
* Trade Networks now have an arrow indicating directional indicators as to which way they flow at the end of many paths.
* Changed color of Hungary, so it doesn't exactly match Magyars (since Magyars will still exist when Hungary is formed).
* Added a holding decision which allows the player to remove non-capital holdings from the province. Requirements: you personally own the holding, the county, AND the duchy, there is at least one other holding of that type in the province, you are not at war, and the province does not have the "chaos" modifier which is added after conquering it. The AI will not use this, period.
* "Holes" in the roman empire plugged


3.09.0

* Updated for the CK2 2.4.2 patch -- do NOT try to use with 2.4.1 or earlier
* Nomadic and Tribal rulers given access to all gender laws
* Women can be sent off to be mercenaries, provided their liege does not have agnatic succession and they have a Martial Lady trait
* Characters created via the Ruler Designer should now properly receive the startup events (the Crowned trait, Byzantine initialization event, etc.)
* Coronations are now properly cancelled when a war occurs.
* Invasion CB now works against non-kingdoms. CB description updated to reflect what it actually does in Plus.
* Shi'a Caliphate Uprising revised: the uprising is now led by the current proper claimant to the Shiite Caliphate. If there is no such claimant (due to the Fatimids having been wiped out or converted), they will find a pretender much as in the current version -- though he will be an adult, and not a 3-year old child. If the uprising is successful, the new caliph's levies will be properly refilled (they are meant to do so in the CB, it just doesn't work) and he will receive an army of followers to establish his empire. Should the Caliphate be created prior to the uprising event, that new caliph will receive the army instead.
* Monks and nuns now receive the "Brother" and "Sister" title before their names, and will change their appearance (tonsure/robes for monks and a white hood for nuns).
* Lords/Ladies now receive the title before their name.
* Fixed the Paulician use of the Holy War CB on same-religion group targets.
* Yazidi religion is no longer localized as Salafi.
* Added some logic for where heresies appear -- they are more likely to show up in their historical areas (such as Catharism in southern France), and occasionally instead of a "heresy" the character/province may instead switch to another religion in the same religion group (such as a Sunni province embracing Shiia), though only where it's logical to do so. On the rare occasion, a potential heretic may embrace another religion group entirely, though again only where it's logical for that to occur (a Muslim may decide to become Manichaean, for instance, but only in Persia or Central Asia).
* Reduced piety loss for Cathars who have children, and removed the prestige loss entirely.
* Added a base -25% fertility for all Cathars.
* Cathars may now also use the adoption decision if they are over 45 or have less than 5% fertility.
* Added Adoptionist as a new Catholic heresy (no special mechanics).
* Added Tondrakian as a new Miaphysite heresy (no special mechanics yet, but they are feminist like the Messalians or Cathars).
* Added Quranist as a new Sunni heresy (no special mechanics, but they can only have 1 wife and can form a caliphate).
* Added Qarmatian as a new Shiite heresy (no special mechanics yet, but they can raid, receive an offensive bonus, and can form a caliphate).
* Manichaeism is no longer a Zoroastrian heresy, but rather a religion of its own within the same religion group. Zurvanism has been added as a Zoroastrian heresy, and Mandaean has been added as a Manichaean heresy.
* Updated the Manichaean faith, as per the Heretic Pride mod. Manichaeans now:
- Have a religious head, which exists in the Charlemagne and Old Gods bookmarks, and can be restored afterwards.
- Have their own holy feast decision, the Bema Feast.
- Receive a defensive bonus for their armies, on their own territory.
- May dedicate themselves to a Shekhinah upon adulthood.

- Have a religion head title which can be created
- Receive a defensive bonus for their armies, on their own territory.
- May dedicate themselves to a Power upon adulthood.
- May have priestesses, and have no negative opinions for female rulers.

- Non-Perfect Messalians may join the Cult of Lucifer
- May choose a patron saint to worship
- Can form a new Holy Order, the Army of Lucifer
- Receive an Intrigue bonus, but a Diplomacy malus
* Updated the Hurufi faith, as per the Heretic Pride mod. Hurufis now:
- May create epic works of Islamic poetry.
- May study the secrets of the Qur'an and gain benefits from doing so.
- Receive a learning bonus but a martial malus.

3.08.0

* Added a warning event that fires at the beginning of the game if you are using Ironman -- some mod features (such as the Imperial Decadence system) have been disabled in Ironman due to save corruption issues that result with the mode, and there are enough issues that we don't recommend using it. If you wish to do so anyhow, go ahead, but please refrain from reporting issues encountered while using Ironman on the CK2+ forums.
* The Lord Spiritual can now be female for ALL religions that allow female temple holders, instead of just some.
* All non-Muslim Lord Spirituals save for Lollards must now be either temple holders or have an ecclesiastical education.
* Waldensian bishops may not be Chancellors or Lord Treasurers.
* Cleaned up some of the cultural retinues
* Altered much of the de jure layout in Germany and Lotharingia. Of major note: Both the Duchy of Oldenberg and the Duchy of Brunswick are no longer de jure titles, replaced respectively by the Duchy of Westphalia and the Duchy of Eastphalia. Those both comprise the territory of the historical Duchy of Saxony, which is now eliminated as a de jure ducal title (but still exists as a kingdom-tier title). The Margraviate of Brandenburg added as a kingdom-tier de jure title, active in the 1066 start but previous to that formable if the HRE or one of its duchies gains complete control over Brandenburg and Meissen.
* Reformed Celtic pagans should no longer switch back to Tanistry after they change from it.
* Celtic children should no longer die in druidic training after training has completed.
* Celtic rulers using Offerings to the Sidhe can now have a (smaller) effect on whether provinces owned by direct vassals (or all vassals if top liege is using the decision) gain/lose the Restless Sidhe modifier.
* Using de jure CB's on behalf of your vassals when targeting a valid Holy War target now works once again.
* De jure CB's which cannot be used due to insufficient Crown Authority now display on your list of CB's, but are greyed-out with the reason given.
* Fixed viking invasion CB so it properly grants all occupied counties to the attacker again.
* Rebel reinforcement events should no longer fire on the same day as the original uprising.
* Fixed the "quietly kill him" option for the Kidnap plot to not kill the plotter.
* Updated Iconoclast heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Iconoclasts now have extra events, may destroy icons upon besieging a christian temple (and receive the Icon-Breaker trait), and receive a morale bonus for their armies. It is now also possible for an emperor besides the ruler of Byzantium to create an Iconoclast Patriarch.
* Restored the missing d_paulician title, and added its historical holders from founding through to 872 AD. In the 867 start, the Paulicians hold the county of Coloneia and have an army of zealots.
* Updated Paulician heresy as per the Heretic Pride mod. Paulicians now:
- May raid, as pagans do
- May declare Holy War on anyone not of the same religion
- The Paulician Patriarch may declare Crusade against anyone not of the same religion
- Receive a morale bonus and an offensive bonus for light infantry
- May expend Piety to raise units of zealots
- Can receive the Icon-Breaker trait after besieging a Christian temple
* Norse culture provinces should no longer randomly change culture when part of a norse empire.
* Players are no longer restricted from converting to pagan religions if Moral Authority is greater than 50% (the the AI will never do so). They do, however, first need to have received instruction from a mystic on the ancient religion (the event that pops up several years after they've accepted a mystic into their court) and must have the correct traits (pagan sympathy and either cynical or mystic).
* Added note on losing access to raiding and county conquest/subjugation CB's in the reform religion tooltip.
* Fixed the lollard revocation decision.
* Duel Engine changes:
- Reduced health bonuses from high level warrior traits
- Added option to run away from some ongoing duels. High intrigue and certain traits
will increase the odds of successful escape. Failing to escape will give the winner
the choice to capture or execute, as if you yielded.
- Duel Engine is now used to resolve holmgangs, duels at coronation and regular feasts,
duels with rivals (both from the Way of Life Combat focus action and from the random
challenge event), and duels with your spouse's lover.
* Disabled Legitimise Bastard decision for mothers, as intended.
Mothers still automatically legitimise any bastards born while they are married matrilineally.
* Fixed duplicate options in "seduce guest at your feast" event
* Germanic Pagans made more distinct from Nordic Pagans (holy sites moved and religion head given distinct title)
* Fixed issue where some elective-style succession laws were still allowed to change to some types of successions without a vote.
* The "Request Religious Conversion" decision now also converts all same-dynasty, non-ruler courtiers of vassals who agree to the conversion.
* The Pope no longer causes provinces under his rule to convert to his culture.

3.07.6

* Bavaria/Saxony kings (and ducal vassals) no longer become independent when the Carolingian Empire is formed by a Frankish emperor.
* Patrician mansion holdings are no longer given out with the automated "give out holdings" decision.
* The "Found Merchant Republic" and "Adopt Feudalism" decisions are both now visible to players from the outset.
* The automated decisions to ransom prisoners are now only visible if you actually have prisoners (they previously appeared if some of your courtiers were held prisoner by others).
* Decadence may now occasionally increase if a muslim emperor has a very large realm, regardless of their other traits.
* Added a new type of revolter: decadence uprising, which can occur under a muslim ruler with 50+ decadence and in provinces with the "decadence unrest" province modifier (which can occasionally appear in provinces under a top liege with high decadence). This works the same as other revolters, with victory establishing a new realm under the revolter's rule.
* AI female tribal rulers no longer have access to the "Convert to Temple" decision if they are part of a religion that doesn't allow female temple holders.
* Fixed Muslim religion heads switching to Open Elective when the religious title is their primary one.
* Fixed "Blackmail Plotter" diplo-action so the player can properly receive the target's response.
* Fixed up events involving druidic training for Celtic pagans, so it's a bit more reliable in terms of finishing the event chain.
* The Kharijite heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Kharijites now:
- Have no 5-year cooldown on Holy Wars (it always costs 100 Piety for them)
- May expend 250 Piety to raise zealot armies, in the same fashion that tribals use Prestige
- Have access to the Public Execution diplo action, usable on prisoners who are either kafir or non-Kharijites, giving prestige and piety (based on the prisoner's importance)
- May accuse immoral vassals of apostasy (and be accused), making them kafir (and giving a large negative to opinions from other Kharijites)
- Kafir have access to decisions to remove immoral traits, and thus clear their name of apostasy
* The Cathar heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Cathars now:
- Cannot use the Holy War cb until Holy War or Crusade has been used by a Catholic against a Cathar
- May create the Cathar Papacy
- Have access to the Consolamentum decision to make themselves Perfectum
- Perfectum/Celibate Cathar rulers may adopt an heir
- May not choose the Seduction or Family focus
- Have lowered garrison and levy sizes, but higher morale
- Have an event to spawn their creation in southern France in the early 12th century
* The Lollard heresy has been updated with a conversion of events used in the Heretic Pride mod. Lollards now:
- Lollard bishops may marry
- Can gain the Icon-Breaker trait by sacking Christian temples
- Have a decision to translate the Bible, increasing their MA and reducing Catholic MA
- May freely revoke titles of priests who are non-Lollard or who have the Wicked Priest trait
- May gain strong claims to Lollard priests who have titles of Duke rank or higher

- Waldensian priests can both marry and inherit
- Have a decision to translate the Bible, increasing their MA and reducing Catholic MA

* Integrated the New Duel Engine and Combat Trait Advancement, reduced the frequency of nameless vanilla battle deaths/woundings/maimings/brainings accordingly.
* Most heresies are now allowed in the character designer.
* Fixed global flags being set in the history files (effects Hungary creation, plus a few other minor things).
* Many updates to the EU4 Converter
- Many titles, such as the stem duchies of the HRE, have now been properly assigned to their EU4 equivalent
- Due to a recent fix in the converter many titles are now assigned to their proper CK2+ analogies, instead of CK2
- Updated for EU4 version 1.12 (Common Sense Patch)
- Ibadi now actually converts to the EU4 form of Ibadi
- Rio de Janeiro should no longer be improperly assigned to someone in Europe
* The Roman Province titles should properly localize as "Provincia" now.
* There are no longer "holes" in the de jure area of the Roman Province titles after they are formed.
* Corrected Bedouin and Egyptian Retinues

3.07.5

* Added a new "Imperial Decadence" system which affects all non-Muslim empires (and replaces the "State of the Empire" modifiers for the Byzantium). This is a variable between 0 and 100 which will increase by 3 or more (the amount gets higher the larger and more centralized the empire is) each time the title changes hands. As the variable gets above 10, the ruler will receive an Imperial Decadence modifier which reduces troop morale, levies, and global taxes by an amount that increases as the variable does. Imperial Decadence raises further if the empire loses wars or has a ruler/regent with negative traits (on a random basis). Imperial Decadence can be lowered through coronations, tournaments, winning wars (major rebellions, holy wars, crusades, and de jure imperial claims), and the ruler/regent having positive traits (on a random basis). There is also a Lower Imperial Decadence decision available every five years which can pass reforms to reduce the decadence variable, but at the cost of 1000 Prestige and 100 Piety. Some realms, like Byzantium, will begin the game with levels of Imperial Decadence already in place -- all other empires build it up as time goes on.
* Added a bunch of tooltip to the new "Attempt Religious Conversion" diplo action which should give players a bit more insight into their options and chances of success.
* Fixed the Third Temple event so it shows the proper builder name, and added a boost to Jewish RA after it's built.
* Characters who are away from their home courts during a war will have a lower chance of discovering plots and will be unable to have more children while they're away.
* If the holder of a caliphate rises above 80 decadence, other rulers of their religion (Dukes or greater) who have low decadence may claim the caliph title.
* Made lowering decadence as a Muslim a little bit easier ( tho it can still swing upwards quickly if not watched carefully ).
* If an emperor gains a second imperial title, he will now be forced to choose between them. There can be only one empire.
* Tweaked the cannibal modifier.
* Allowed Old Saxon culture to form the Kingdom of Saxony.
* Bug fixed when enacting the "Rebuild Persepolis" decision at more than max number of holdings for the province.
* Merchant Republics now begin the game with more money, and access to additional starting forces and retinue cap through their palace.
* Small Merchant Republics (under 30 realm size) can summon their patricians to the republic's defense if they are attacked by an outside force.
* All holy orders (rather than just some) will now ask to build a castle in an applicable ruler's province when they gather 600 gold. They only ask to build in provinces that already have all three main holding types (castle, city, temple), will not build more than one castle in the same province, and a given ruler can only be asked this once in their lifetime.
* Reconquering Roman territory as the Byzantine or Roman empire will now result in the creation of a "Provincia" corresponding with the reconquest events. These are the only kingdoms that Byzantium or the Roman Empire can hold without changing away from the "No vassal kingdoms" law. Byzantium can not hold Provincia Thracia, the Roman Empire can not hold Provincia Roma, forcing the Emperor of either empire to rule the "home" territory without a vassal king to hand it off to.
* Historical High Kings of Ireland given their title. Irish tribal dukes may now use a decision to give themselves a strong claim to the High King title, if its holder is also tribal. The decision requires the ruler be ambitious and have 250 Prestige.
* Revamped the conditions under which a courtier will ask to join a holy order so they make sense. They will first get divorced if they are married (and leave behind children), as well as sell any of their estates. Piety loss/gain for the liege will vary depending on whether they are a child, a close relative, or neither. If refused, the courtier will not ask the same liege again for at least ten years.
* The Settle Tribe job for the steward can now allow the liege to succeed at the Civilize a Province ambition.
* Celtic Pagan rulers now cannot switch from Tanistry to another succession type, as is supposed to be the case.
* Fixed the CB which enforces a claim for others to still trigger success for the Win a War ambition.
* Succession Crisis now applies to Tanistry and Feudal Elective realms as well.
* Limited notification events for wounded and maimed characters in a tournament to members of the top liege's court, vassals, dynasty and close relatives.
* The Sunni Caliphate (AI only) may now experience a period of anarchy (known historically as the Anarchy at Samarra) if there is a particularly weak caliph between 800 and 900 AD -- the caliph will be all but imprisoned by his court, and his vassal limit will drop dramatically until either he or a successor can restore order. In the Old Gods bookmark, this period of anarchy is already underway.
* Characters with more than one sympathy trait can receive an event where a fellow courtier who is zealous challenges them, and they will either drop one of their sympathy traits or gain the cynical trait and an enemy.
* Guardian traits should now influence which traits their wards end up with a bit more.

3.07.4

* The regular 'Demand Religious Conversion' diplo action has been removed. It has been replaced with 'Attempt Religious Conversion' -- usable under in the same circumstances (though it costs 50 Piety to attempt to convert a vassal, instead of simply 10 for a courtier), you will need to decide your approach (diplomacy, religious debate, or threat of imprisonment if you have at least Medium CA/Tribal Organization) and then the target will respond either with refusal, conversion, or sympathy (though sympathy cannot be gained with threats). Each approach has a different chance of working, depending on the target and circumstances, though only diplomacy/debate can get a target to honestly convert (otherwise they will likely remain sympathetic to their old religion, and/or become Cynical). Be careful debating someone with higher Learning than you, or you may end up becoming sympathetic to THEIR religion, instead!
* Religion heads now always pay 100 Piety for holy wars (never 250), and can go into Piety "debt" if they so desire.
* Fixed stem duchy creation when HRE is created without East Francia having existed first.
* Fixed some duplicate retinues
* Fixed Mongol Empire split event
* "Protected Inheritance" (titles cannot succeed to outside the realm) moved from High to Medium Crown Authority.
* "King's Peace" moved from Medium to High Crown Authority.
* "Title Revocation" moved from Autonomous Vassals to Limited Crown Authority.
* Finally fixed the issue where Liberation Revolt leaders would sometimes end up with a city or temple capital.
* Provinces that are isolated from the top liege's capital now get +2% revolt risk.
* The game's consideration of what's considered a province contiguous to the capital now crosses a single sea zone.
* The Kidnap plot has been re-enabled for the AI to use. The AI will now use it if they are at war with the target, the target has a plot against them (and they can't arrest him), they have a reason to execute the target (and can't arrest him) or the target is a fellow vassal in the same realm with either a vassal or a county that they claim or which is de jure theirs. The player can use the Kidnap plot on anyone, but demanding a county or vassal follows the same restrictions (only against a fellow vassal, and only if the target is yours by claim or by de jure right). You have the option of quietly killing the target if they refuse your demand, but their spymaster may discover the truth. There is another version of the Kidnap plot which is only available for non-rulers, originally used if they were refused a title after a demand (or you broke a promise to give them one). It may now also be used by courtiers with a claim on a county, though the chance is far less if their claim is weak.
* Fixed the "going native" event to work in a way that makes sense.
* Fixed the nomination of vestal virgins so a player only can receive it once a year (if they happen to be Pontifex Maximus), and so it properly only applies to girls who aren't already vestalis and properly only goes to a maximum of five at a time.
* Non-titular kingdom titles for which a ruler has none of its de jure titles as part of his realm will now be destroyed shortly after being inherited.
* Bumped up slightly the number of troops an adventurer is likely to get.
* EU4 Converter: fixed bug with rebel types that was causing broken EU4 saves.

3.07.3

* Emergency bug patch: cultural buildings now buildable again
* The AI will never send anyone into hiding if the plot is known about and has less than 50% plot power.
* AI characters with possessed trait no longer pick irrational targets to murder -- they only are far more likely to make the attempt. Lunatics still pick irrational targets.
* Number of opinion modifiers which cause the "is_foe" trigger expanded, and made applicable for the Take Revenge plot.

3.07.2

* Holy Wars no longer have a 5-year cooldown before you can use the CB again. Instead, the CB costs 100 Piety to use, and 250 Piety if you've used it within the last five years. This cost is exempt if the duchy you target contains a holy site of your religion OR if you receive sanction from your religion head (if you have one). Sanction requires positive Piety and is acquired through the diplo menu on the target ruler, and your religion head may accept, refuse, or ask for an incentive (in the form of coin, prestige, or a promised temple in the target duchy).
* Ambitious city mayors now have access to a "Usurp County" plot, if they rule either one of the historical merchant republic cities or are in a port city with a highly developed port (though not one in a county that is the capital of a duchy or kingdom). It's only usable on AI targets, but if successful the city will switch to become the capital of the province (if not already) and the mayor will usurp the county (leaving their former liege as the ruler of a barony instead).
* Added separate character modifier icons for each of the main factions, so you can tell which faction a vassal is in by looking at their character info.
* Fixed a result where the faction demands that one of the liege's counties be turned over to the liege -- resulting in the liege going independent -- if the liege was part of the same faction they are, but for his own liege.
* Factions now get a +50 opinion bonus when their demands are agreed to, not +25.
* The faction leader now properly gains prestige when his demand is agreed to, instead of losing it.
* Kings and emperors with low crown authority (Low or Autonomous Vassals CA) and either Primogeniture, Seniority, or Ultimogeniture succession may now undergo a succession crisis if their heir is either considered too young (under 13), is unsuitable (incapable, inbred, lunatic or imbecile), or is female and there are other, possible better options. The vassals will vote to see who gains the throne, provided there is no revolt under way or war for the primary title. Note that the other candidates will be either pretenders (next in line for the throne), children (it may opt for an older daughter even in Agnatic), or dynasty members (the "Seniority" option, for one).
* Feudal kings or emperors with High or Absolute CA may now ask vassals who support them (opinion of 50+) to also support their heir once he comes to power, adding a +50 opinion bonus towards the heir for twenty years. They may refuse, but are less likely to under Absolute CA. It costs prestige to use the decision (100 for a Count, 250 for a Duke, 500 for a King).
* Shattered Realm has been slightly revamped:
- Depending on which tier of the ruling tiers you select, ie Count, Duke or King, each playable ruler will get a starting fund of around 500, 750 and 1500 respectively
- A new CB has been added only for Shattered Realm that allows no timer county conquest on any ruler up until realm size 60. It also can't be used after 60 years of the shattered realm start.
- The way ancient religions picks areas for said religions has been improved. This should cause a slight speed gain on first map generation of any Ancient Religions starts
* Fixed a bug where the Rise of the Hansa event would fire in a province without a city and create a feudal titular king.
* Landless titles (like the mongols) are no longer automatically destroyed when they drop below 100 holdings.
* After a revolt (either to overthrow the ruler or an independence revolt), a king- or emperor-tier primary title with 0 Crown Authority may be destroyed. This requires that the CA was raised to 1 at some point in the game (so they don't collapse after their first rebellion, especially in early timelines), and the ruler will have a chance to salvage their title if they pay half the cost it would to make a custom title of the same tier (they may go into debt, provided they don't already have a loan and have a current positive wealth total). Landless titles are exempt.
* Province-spawned revolts disabled from occurring during the first two years of the game.
* Levies should now properly refill after converting from tribal holdings, so you're not left weak as a kitten until they refill.
* Corrected an issue where vassals with multiple de jure titles would get to vote more than once on succession law changes.
* Title allows re-written to be more uniform and comprehensible
* The Byzantine, Roman, and Holy Roman empires can no longer create kingdom level vassals (with a few exceptions) unless the player changes their laws.
* Lifestyle traits can now again be gained even without the Focus events.
* Fixed Jewish holy site in Negev.
* Cultural buildings are now based on the culture of the province rather than the culture of the ruler.
* Cultural buildings now no longer disappear when the culture of the province changes -- instead, the old cultural buildings will stick around for a few years and be converted into the new culture's buildings. Until the conversion happens, you will not be able to build the new culture's cultural buildings.
* Fixed issue with targeting possible holy war targets with de jure CB's -- it should work properly, now.


3.07.1

* Fixed the issue with Invite to Court, Invite to Plot, and Demand Religious Conversion not working properly.
* Unreformed West African pagans can now properly intermarry with muslims and zoroastrians.
* Added the ability to reveal a known plot, if the plot target isn't already aware of it. This is a decision available in the diplomatic menu, on the plotter.
* Added the ability to blackmail a known plotter, if the plot target isn't already aware of it and if you aren't the plotter's liege or vassal. This is a decision available in the diplomatic menu, on the plotter.
* Reduced the chance of the AI accepting more than one religious sympathy trait.
* Slightly toned down the chance of religious conversion of pagans, particularly before 900 AD.
* Made the Ilkhanate able to end wars/have succession if the player starts in one of the later bookmarks where it is already active.
* Non-nordic raiders now receive their own version of the Viking trait when raiding.
* The champion of a tournament now receives a "Tourney Champion" trait upon winning the tournament.
* The winner of the tournament's beauty contest now receives a "Famous Beauty" trait.
* Vassals with the subjugation opinion modifiers are also now not allowed to join factions against their liege.
* County-tier republics have the option of creating a custom ducal title and becoming merchant republics if they are independent or their liege is king or emperor tier.

3.07.0

* Liberation revolts, provided they are under an existing ruler, will now unite under that ruler the same as faction revolts.
* Fixed several pagan holy orders which were not updating when the religion was reformed (NOTE: this is not retroactive on old saves).
* The Magyars now have a decision to simulate the 867 bookmark's invasion of Carpathia, for a CM bookmark start. It's permitted after 800 if they are between 6-12 realm size and neighbor a realm that owns Pest, though the AI won't take it until much later.
* Conversion of pagans through your lord spiritual made a bit easier.
* Changed how courtiers (and friends) convert others to their religion -- now the first step is to give the target a sympathy trait, and then if they already have the trait they can convert with a later event. Rulers are also made much less likely to convert to different religion groups unless they are in a province of that religion.
* Expanded religions that can intermarry: African pagans and pagans based in the east can nor intermarry with Muslims and Zoroastrians. Pagans based in the west can intermarry with Christians.
* All reformed pagans no longer care about tribal organization.
* Fraticelli lords are now able to hold temples without penalty.
* Roman Empire now has the proper requirements when being created via regular title creation and fires the proper event when created this way
* Germanic Holy Order given Donation and Expulsion decisions
* Missing icons added for the Braedralag donation and Expulsion decisions
* The AI will now destroy custom-created titular titles when and if it gets a non-titular title of equal tier.
* Vanilla event chain where wife tries to poison your heir fixed up -- should also no longer end with the wife imprisoning you instead of the reverse.
* Provinces gained through war will gain a "chaos" modifier that lowers the revolt chance for two years.
* "Holy Warrior" trait added as a crusader-type trait for non-christians/muslims on a Great Holy War.
* Imperial Reconquest CB for the Roman Empire now works for Hellenic rulers as well, but is always treated as a holy war when used against targets of a different religion.
* The duchies for Aland and Isle of Man may now only be formed by someone who is lower than Duke tier and who owns at least three counties -- it is not enough to just own the one province any longer.
* Removed the timer that prevents a player from using the Seduce diplo decision more than once a year -- use it as often as you dare.
* Moved the Suggest Fatwa, Castrate, Blind and Zun Judgement decisions to the diplo menu.
* The Suggest Fatwa may now only be used against the head of a dynasty.
* Chances of becoming ill/pneumonic or infertile/barren after giving birth have been modified, with the chance going up the older the mother gets. Mothers with the Strong trait fare much better, while mothers with the Weak trait fare much worse. Those traits also affect the newborn's chance of being born ill or sickly.
* Recovering from an illness or the Wounded/Maimed trait comes with a chance of it reducing your base Health -- you can still recover that over time, as well, so long as you are not currently away from your court or besieged. The chances of recovery go up with high Learning, high Martial, or youth.

3.06.6

* Fixed Hamburg to properly be a republic in 1066.
* Pechenegs no longer show as vassals of Khazaria in 867.
* Mongols will no longer default to Open Elective succession.
* AI discouraged from using holy war CB on titles that are not neighbors to continguous land.
* Slighty decreased supply limit for provinces infected with small pox and the bubonic plague. Also added a small revolt risk to provinces having a disease outbreak.
* The Theodosian Walls will no longer disappear under an AI Byzantine emperor.
* Cadet system revamped. Now a cadet is flagged as such if he has an older legitimate brother, is in a dynasty with 40+ living members, and the dynasty head is not a close relative to him or his wife or parents. He also cannot be married matrilineally or be heir to any titles. Provided none of that changes, should he eventually get a title (that does not have tanistry, seniority, or elective gavelkind succession) he may establish a cadet branch dynasty of his own (though the AI will only do this if they are ambitious, proud, or a legitimatised bastard). The player can only establish a cadet branch if they take over play of a character who has previously been flagged as a possible cadet but are otherwise eligible.
* Muslim rulers (who are either kings or independent) that are part of a large, decadent dynasty and not closely related to the dynasty head will have the decision to start their own dynasty, even if they are not cadets.
* Ambitious rulers who are kings or independent dukes and not closely related to the dynasty head may also start their own dynasty at the cost of 1000 Prestige, even if they are not cadets. This is not permitted to men who are married matrilineally (or women who aren't), and is not permitted for rulers with tanistry, seniority, or elective gavelkind succession unless they are in a different realm from their dynasty head.
* AI made slightly less likely to marry below their rank or accept a marriage offer below their rank.
* Asking for claims from your religion head now requires 250 Piety, not 100, and also requires 100 coin. They are also a bit less likely to agree.
* Converted some Central Asian and Russia provinces to tribal in CM and TOG start dates.
* Courtiers of holy orders and mercenaries are no longer eligible to become adventurers.
* Removed the de jure kingdom of Alania, folded it and part of the western arm of Cumania into a de jure kingdom of Khazaria.
* Revamped how the Mongol Empire works in CK2: now, if one starts prior to the Mongol bookmark, when they appear it will be with Genghis Khan as the ruler of the Mongol Empire (as opposed to the Il-Khanate and the Golden Horde separately). Genghis is the proper age and will have all the family who were with him at the time. When and if the ruler of the Mongol Empire dies with at least two chidren and enough territory, the Mongol Empire ceases to be and the territory is split amongst the new hordes: the Golden Horde, the Il-Khanate and, if there's a third son, the Chagatai Khanate (renamed to the Moghul Khanate if not ruled by Chagatai).
* Fixed the instance where an out-of-realm claimant could end up from the wrong liege after a victorious pretender faction installs them to the title.
* Added a Germanic Holy Order.
* Made Germanic a Defensive religion in order to give Charlemagne a bit more of a fight.
* Moved Boleslaw's capital to Poznan in the 1000 bookmark. Made Greater Poland his primary title.
* Jizya Tax modifier now lowers levies gathered by the province in addition to increasing income (balance fix).
* Decadent muslims can now only be told to straighten up by their liege, their father, or their dynasty head.
* Decadence trait gain now requires one of the sinful traits, and the presence of sinful/virtuous traits will have greater affect on whether it's acquired.
* The initial formation of the HRE now requires 150 holdings, not 100 provinces.
* De jure claims may now be fought against holy war targets -- the main difference is that it will be treated like a holy war, in that they will be able to call in nearby members of their faith just as with a Holy War. Also as per a holy war, you will not vassalize any of the target's vassals who are not your religion and will instead usurp those lower titles directly.
* Religious difference now impact opinion more: Same religion group is -25, Different religion group and heretics are -50.
* Fixed matrilineal marriages in the history files so they will actually be matrilineal in the game.
* Liberation revolts should now be seen a bit more often -- they occur in any province where the province's culture is different from the ruler, but the same as its de jure kingdom. One big change: when a nationalist revolt occurs, the rebels will go "up the chain" of rulers to see if anyone will lead them. They will also ask rulers of their culture (or culture group, if the ruler is of a different one) to join them in the revolt. Unlike other revolts, success means the rebel leader usurps any titles in the kingdom belonging to the ruler or any of his vassals who are of his culture, a different culture group, or who don't have their capital in the kingdom. Everyone else is vassalized, if possible, or their titles usurped.
* Added an "Incite Revolt" plot which rulers can target their top liege with if he is not of their culture, the ruler's capital province is of their culture and religion, and its de jure kingdom is also of his culture. Essentially he attempts to promote unrest in his own province in the hopes of leading the nationalist revolt when/if it occurs.

3.06.5

* Factions are no longer displeased when you grant a landed title -- they are only pleased when you grant a landed title to a member of their faction.
* Claimants to a title you grant, if they are in your realm, will be displeased if you don't grant it to them or a close relative of theirs (-20 if they have a strong claim, -10 if they have a weak claim).
* For the EU4 converter, religion icon strips updated for "El Dorado"
* Fixed de jure claims for vassals to work properly -- de jure claims may now be enforced on behalf of vassals so long as they hold a de jure title (although a kingdom or empire de jure title must still be medium CA or greater)
* Elective Gavelkind now requires a vote from your vassals in order to change the succession law, the same as Tanistry or Feudal Elective.
* Both Tanistry and Feudal Elective are now options for a ruler moving from Elective Gavelkind. Tanistry is available to tribals, as Gavelkind is.
* The cooldown for holy wars is now not added until after the war is resolved (in case it becomes invalid).
* The Carolingian Empire now begins as an Elective Gavelkind rather than a Feudal Elective title.
* Independence events for heirs (under elective gavelkind) or for vassals when the liege is over the vassal limit have been tweaked to make more sense. Independence cannot be declared if the ruler is a child, is imprisoned, or is incapable. The declaration also looks at whether independence will put them next to a larger neighbour who can declare holy war on them.
* Automated stat changes based on age groups have been tweaked, as per LordPeter's suggestion.
* Corrected a few Bulgarian provinces to tribal in CM start
* Brought the cost of creating custom kingdom/empire titles in line with creating standard titles.
* Fixed varangian events so the son can actually return home.
* Unreformed tribals with Tanistry will no longer automatically revert to Gavelkind.
* Tribal vassals now will occasionally convert their holdings to cities or temples, even under feudal lieges.
* Abdication no longer banishes the former ruler to a foreign court.
* Spread out annual maintenance events over a month rather than having them all occur simultaneously (should hopefully help with processor overload-related crashes).

3.06.4

* De jure kingdom assimilation changed from 50 to 100 years.
* De jure empire assimilation changed from 100 to 50 years.
* Vassal limits very reduced: base vassal limit reduced for rank: Duke from 10 to 5, King from 20 to 10, Emperor from 30 to 15, Tribal penalty from -10 to -5.
* Vassal limit reduction based on decadence increased from 25% to 50%.
* Reduced bonus to vassal limit based on Crown Authority (from 12\9\6\3\0 to 10\7\4\2\0).
* Demesne size bonus from Legalism moved to a law which changes automatically rather than a modifier.
* Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia in 867AD now spawns troops based on target strength.
* Amount of forces spawned by Prepared Invasions now increased slightly, as is frequency of events occurring (still based on comparison to target's strength, however).
* Prepared Invasion CB is no longer considered a holy war.
* Moved most de jure kingdom CB's to the new region system (so they remain useable even if new de jure kingdoms appear).
* Beefed up the Shiia Revolt event slightly, and restricted it to certain geographical regions.
* AI muslims no longer go pagan (via the system of "pursuing ancient knowledge").
* Gave the Doge of Venice more gold at CM start.
* Reverted most of the balkans in the CM start to tribals.
* Revised the "introduce two friends" event chain so it makes more sense to the player what's actually happened.
* Fixed decadence gain from muslim barons.
* The HRE's creation will now have Germany return de jure control of duchies it has previously absorbed outside of its traditional borders.
* The HRE's initial creation will now rename West Francia if its renaming did not previously occur.
* Various factions now disapprove of high decadence.
* The victors in a separatist civil war also have the chance of losing control of distant/weakly-held territories after they separate.
* Fixed some counts beginning the game with a primary title not matching their capital.
* It is no longer possible to take the "Adopt the Old Ways" decision if you do not have the appropriate DLC (TOG for pagans/Zoroastrians, SOA for Jews, TOG and Charlemagne for Zunists). Doing so before would cause a CTD.
* Fixed tooltip for bastards born to matrilineally-married mothers.
* Faction anger over the granting of titles to non-landed courtiers has changed: the reaction is now delayed, in order to see what faction they join. The one they join will be pleased, while the others will still be slightly upset. The reaction now applies to all non-landed courtiers who aren't your children, even if they're of your dynasty.
* You will no longer receive the Recent Holy War cooldown if you engage in a holy war that is part of your de jure empire.
* Added a maintenance event to ensure patricians and merchant republics have the correct succession laws.
* The AI will no longer pass viceroy laws -- they are restricted to the ERE and players who wish to use them.
* The AI will not begin pretender wars for the first two years of the game, much like independence wars.
* Fixed rulers sometimes receiving Uncrowned trait at the beginning of the game.
* Fixed holy war CB so it can be used by Buddhists again.
* The Abbasids now start off with kingdom titles for Syria and Mesopotamia (to give them some actual de jure territory).
* Adventurers will now sell their estates before they leave, and will not buy new ones with the money they collect while preparing.
* Non-Muslim women may now have their claims enforced on agnatic titles, but the AI will only do so if they have a son or are formidable in some way (or their religion is feminist).
* Revamped how separatist and pretender factions are formed. Among the changes:
- Pretenders can now be from other realms, and can potentially be called in as allies once the civil war begins.
- Non-muslim women can now be pretenders for agnatic titles, but the AI won't support them unless they have a son or are formidable in some way.
- Preference for women in enatic and enatic-cognatic titles now included in the logic.
- Rulers with the Uncrowned trait are much more likely to see pretender factions form.
- Pretender factions are a bit more likely to coalesce around a single candidate, especially in conquered titles.
- Vassals are unlikely to join a pretender faction for a title they have a weak claim to unless it already has considerable support.
- Pretender faction takes into account not only how much the claimant is liked, but their stats compared to the liege's.
- Independence faction also takes into account whether the ruler is over their vassal limit.
- Vassals are unlikely to join an independence faction if independence would place them next to a stronger ruler who can wage holy war against them.
- Vassals are much more likely to join an independence faction the further their capital is away from their liege's.
* Vassals who have truces with their lords can no longer join Independence, Pretender, Antiking, or Religious factions. Claimants who have truces with the title holder cannot be supported by a Pretender faction.
* Regents are no longer randomly replaced by event, and there is no longer a "Become Regent" ambition. There is, however, now a "Replace Regent" plot, usuable by a ruler's courtiers and councillors when a regent is active.
* There is now also a "Usurp Titles" plot which may be used by a regent upon an adult, incapable ruler. Heirs can execute this plot relatively quickly, others less so, though in either case a lot of plot power is needed (gathered through the support of the ruler's vassals) in order to succeed.
* Faction members will now have an opinion modifier on their leader based on how close their opinions of their liege are.
* The EU4 converter now properly converts generic pagans.
* Corrected a few bad religion conversions in the EU4 converter.
* Fixed a bug that prevented some localisation from loading in the EU4 converter.
* Added missing localisation to some custom nation idea sets for the EU4 converter.
* Fixed 'the Anarchy' bookmark so the English revolt works properly.
* It is now actually possible to form the HRE if the Carolingian Empire was never formed.

3.06.3

* Fixed spying event chain when you choose to immediately reveal your target's affair.
* The AI will fight for claims of spouses and occasionally friends/lovers even if that doesn't mean they'll become vassals afterwards.
* Adjusted the balance in scandinavia in the 769 start (specifically Sjaelland)
* Changed Slesvig's localization to Jylland since that's the proper name for the area the duchy encompasses.
* Changed the Kingdom of Sweden's Norse name to Vilkinaland to differentiate from the duchy of uppland (also because it's historically accurate)
* War during the planning stages of a feast will now properly cancel the feast.
* Elective Gavelkind is now open to non tribals.
* Removal of an antipope via the Antiking CB or the Depose Antipope CB now works normally.
* Tournaments and furusiyya cleaned up to work via triggers, similarly to feasts.
* Tournament 1st/2nd/3rd place events now influenced by personal combat rating as well as martial rating.
* Kemetic, Jewish and Zoroastrian "restore religious head" decisions will now promote the holder of a holy site within the restorer's realm (if available - otherwise another random priest will be promoted), to ensure that the religious head has land and can declare Great Holy Wars if otherwise available.
* Revamped adventurer code so they choose destinations a bit more realistically.
* Spouses of rulers are no longer eligible to become adventurers.
* Adventurers will no longer leave children and/or spouses behind as they move from court to court.
* Religion heads will no longer confront themselves over heresies in their own provinces.
* Holmgangs will now only have one possible outcome (previously you could get up to three if the defender had a much higher Combat Rating).
* Exapanded conversion of norse culture to include consideration of top liege culture.
* Norse characters will now be able to convert to any post-norse culture in their realm, and will only see one decision for it.
* Expanded eligible group of tribal courtiers who can initiate the temple-building chain.
* AI tribal rulers will now employ a priest, if they don't have one within their court (to enable the temple-building chain).
* Fixed some opinion modifiers being improperly applied during faction meetings.
* Giving titles to unlanded courtiers who are not of the ruler's dynasty or close relatives results in ALL factions being slightly displeased.
* Reformed pagans may now proseyletize to non-reformed pagan rulers, just as non-pagans can. Tweaked AI logic on reacting to missionaries.
* Removed 'Free Family' CB, since there's now a hard-coded exception to declaring war on anyone who holds close family members anyway.
* Non-inheriting eldest (and eligible, according to the gender law) children of a Tanist ruler will now get a Strong claim to the title.
* Non-inheriting eldest (and eligible, according to the gender law) children of a Feudal Elective ruler will be more likely to be supported as claimants by the AI.
* Pretenders to Feudal Elective titles will gain Weak, non-inheritable claims to the title upon the ruler's death.
* Implemented divorce mechanic for use by the AI.

3.06.2

* Become King ambition no longer selectable when a vassal (was already invalidated on selection if not independent).
* Spying via the Way of Life decision no longer reveals a lover who is the target's wife or consort.
* Added additional check so guests of feasts do not have their flags cleared before the feast is actually over.
* Court members will no longer auto-marry members of their liege's dynasty.
* Cleaned up feast events to make them mostly work from triggers instead of slowing down the system.
* Tweaked feast events:
-duels are now available to women with martial lady traits
-female and homosexual feast hosts can now seduce feast guests (married or not)
-single and homosexual feast guests can now seduce other guests (married or not)
-possible to become lovers as a result of a successful seduction at a feast
-tweaked chances of triggering and success for seductions at feast
* You may now invite members of the target's court to join a Fabricate Treason plot (when used against a vassal).
* Added tooltips for the factions so it's clear what raises and lowers their moods.
* The "Settle Tribe" job for a tribal ruler's Steward now has the chance to begin city construction if the county is already of the ruler's culture.
* Duchy of Aland added to the technology list.
* Fixed the event chain where adventurers are taken captive and offered to their target for ransom.

* The HRE should not lose de jure land any longer after the fall of the Carolingian Empire.
* Pagan wards no longer care whether guardian takes prisoners/makes sacrifices after sieges.
* Lowered tribal building costs for market village and tribal hillfort.

* Events/decisions which are supposed to be tied to geographical regions will no longer fail to work if the province de jure drifts to a different kingdom title.
* Vassals will no longer ask to replace your councillors during a rebellion.
* Moved Majesty's demesne size bonus to Legalism instead.
* Added a number of law prerequisites into Legalism tech.
* Changed Norse culture conversion events to happen a bit more quickly.
* Limited spread of Outremer culture to the Levant and the Middle East.
* All reformed pagan religion heads are now granted to the player in the same manner as the Norse were.

3.06.1

* The AI will now only use pagan subjugation on neighboring (or very close) territories.
* The AI will now be willing to press antipope claims on the Papacy even if the antipope is not of the ruler's dynasty.
* Moved the county of Sudermanland to the duchy of Uppland to solidify a king of Sweden's power a little
* Increased the holding count of Akershus, Bergenshus, and Trondelag so Norway is no longer just a tasty snack for Sweden or Denmark to munch on
* Moved Norway's capital to Trondelag
* Being caught murdering someone will now give an extra level of Dishonourable (for a total of 2, which wear off at the usual speed) instead of vanilla's permanent "Known Murderer" modifier.
* Factions in the HRE are more disapproving of Crown Authority, and more likely to demand it be reduced.
* The descriptions of Autonomous Vassals and Low Crown Authority now contain a note that Kingdom and Empire de jure claims cannot be made.
* Faction vote results will now display the vote of the player.
* Ruler name has been added to the faction mood tooltips, so they make sense (particularly in the CB code).
* The 'support our liege' faction result now states that prestige is being transferred to the liege, so it's not confusing.
* Revolts that stem from failed imprisonment will no longer be rendered invalid.

3.06.0

* Major revision to the faction system:
* There are now four main factions:
Court (vassals who push for autonomy and recognition)
Prosperity (vassals who are interested in wealth and peace)
Glory (vassals who are interested in prestige and war)
Tradition (vassals who are interested in piety and religion)
* Vassals can join all four factions, but will be drawn to some based on their traits and relations with the faction leader
* Faction leaders have a diplo decision to 'Recruit Faction Member' for any vassal not part of their faction
* Faction members have a diplo decision to 'Court Faction Member' for any other member of their faction
* Faction members sometimes have disputes with disliked faction leaders, which can end in them leaving the faction
* Chancellors have a new 'Negotiate With Faction' result on their Improve Relations job, if they are on the province of a faction leader
* Spymasters have a new 'Undermine Faction Member' result on their Uncover Plots job, if they are on the province of a faction member
* Upon a faction meeting being called, members have the option to call for a vote of no confidence before the meeting can begin
* Factions have a wider variety of things they can demand when they're unhappy, including reversion to an old succession law or surrendering a county to a faction member
* 'Faction Mood' is no longer abstracted -- it is based directly on the prevailing opinion of faction members towards their liege
* When a faction rebellion is defeated, rebels are banned from joining ANY faction for five years
* Tooltips only indicate a change in faction mood when the liege actually has that faction existing
* Actions that change faction opinions now last five years, rather than until the annual faction maintenance
* Factions are pleased when you give a title to a member of their faction
* Faction rebellions now properly remove the Loyalist trait upon the war ending, and the "reward your allies" event should properly fire
* Lieges now get an opinion bonus towards Loyalist vassals, as well as the reverse, for the duration of the war
* Factions are no longer called into a Separatist war
* Pretender faction leaders have a diplo decision to 'Ask to Support Pretender' for any fellow vassal, to get them to support your chosen pretender
* There is now a "Religious Faction" which can form if a vassal is part of the liege's religion group but not the same religion (meaning they are either a heretic or the parent religion). If the faction grows powerful enough, it will demand that the liege convert or will start an overthrow war -- and if that war is successful, the liege will be replaced by an heir/pretender/claimant of the faction's religion or by the faction leader.
* band-aid fix to prevent Carolingian Empire/Holy Roman Empire from gaining de jure territories before they have ever been formed
* fix to France becoming de jure e_france again after the fall of the Carolingian Empire
* fix to prevent carousing from cancelling for "no guests" when invitees have accepted.
* fix to allow the Restless Sidhe modifier to go away from provinces no longer held by Celtic Pagans or Tuatha
* Upped the impact diseases have on the provinces they infect ( effects against charaters remains unchanged)
* Pagan Subjugation CB no longer restricted to neighbors (still restricted to targets in the de jure kingdom of your capital, though)
* Egyptian, Levantine and Bedouin cultures now properly convert in the EU4 Converter
* Several omitted & incorrect provinces have been addressed in the EU4 converter
* Added "the Jailer" for rulers who enjoy having a rather populated prison
* Centralization law removed -- Vassal limits and demesne size modifiers moved to Crown Authority (+12 vassal size at minimum CA with -3 per level down to 0 at max, +0 demesne size at minimum CA with +1 per level up to +4 at max)
* Majesty conveys a bonus to demesne size, with +1 at tech level 2, +2 at tech level 4, +3 at tech level 6 and +4 at tech level 8
* Customs techs now convey a levy bonus as well as a tax bonus
* Adjusted de jure land in and around finland
* Unreformed pagans can now convert to feudalism/republicanism
* Titles that are invalid due to the Charlemagne DLC being active will now reflect that in the tooltip

3.05.7

* compatch for patch 2.3.2
* e_roman_empire no longer switches to Open Elective upon succession.
* Vodi county moved to de jure Estonia
* Anhalt county moved to de jure Saxony, made capital of duchy and kingdom
* Restored culture group limitations to the independence faction code, now that it's fixed

3.5.6

* Primary title's succession laws are no longer automatically copied to lower titles. Succession laws must be changed on a per-title basis, as in vanilla.
* If vote to change Feudal Elective or Tanistry succession fails, half the prestige spent is regained.
* Setup changed at the Charlemagne start:
- West Francia is named Neustria
- Middle Francia is named Austrasia, and extends well into central Germany
- Saxony and Bavaria are both de jure kingdoms
- East Francia does not exist
* The formation of the Carolingian Empire has changed: the ruler must have control of Neustria and Austrasia and either they must control Bavaria and Saxony or control those duchies and their kingdom titles do not exist. Once the Carolingian Empire has formed, West Francia and Middle Francia will be renamed and de jure East Francia will be formed.
* There is no need to pay to form the Carolingian Empire if the ruler is already the Frankish emperor.
* Forming the Carolingian Empire makes the ruler Exalted if they are not already.
* Any Karling king or emperor has a Manifest Destiny CB to take non-Karling lands in Neustria, Austrasia, Saxony or Bavaria which are ruled by someone of the same religion. If they become Exalted, this extends to Frisia, Italy, Burgundy, and Aquitaine. The CB no longer exists after the HRE is formed.
* Made the AI becoming a heretic through the Theology focus much less common.
* Fixed some incorrectly labelled England ties
* Castle,City and Temple infrastructure techs no longer provide tax bonuses and moved them to the Noble,Popular and Religious Customs techs. Noble, Popular and Religious Customs tech no longer provide a small opinion bonus.

3.5.5

* Incapable and infirm characters should no longer be able to compete in the tournament.
* Byzantine emperor in the CM bookmark should now start with the proper coronated trait and flags, so setup will work properly.
* Byzantium no longer gets the "Sicily Regained" event in the CM bookmark start.
* Fixed "Little Queen of Sheba" bookmark.
* Seduction chance of success now takes into account the target's feelings for their current spouse/lover (if any) rather than just their opinion of the seducer.
* A successfully seduced target who is not lustful, a hedonist, or deceitful will break up with their previous lover.
* Fixed the "Break Up" decision to work properly.
* Successful "overthrow ruler" rebellion now has proper results if overthrown ruler is a child.
* Expelling the jews now removes "sympathy judaism" trait. The AI will not use the decision if they have the trait.
* Welcoming the jews back into your lands now may add the "sympathy judaism" trait. It will remove the zealous trait, if you have it.
* Pagan Subjugation CB now properly fulfills the Win a War ambition.
* Viceroys will attempt to pass on their wealth (and debts) to a relative rather than onto their liege.
* Mending the Schism is now far more likely to convert enough provinces so that it isn't automatically reversed a month later.
* Abdication and Disinheritance are now easier for the player to take, with restrictions mostly moved to AI use.
* Fixed too-long Chronicle entries which could cause a save game to break.
* Rulers inheriting a new primary title (Duchy or above) from distant relatives (or usurping such a title from any member of their dynasty) now have a choice to form a new dynasty as a cadet of the previous one. Players get this choice if the title they inherit/usurp is higher than any title they previously held.

3.5.4

* For any Shattered World, ancient religions start the inheritance law rules regarding non-gender type inheritance has been relaxed to be the same as any non-tribal Christian in a regular game
* Italian Reconquest chain should no longer fire for the "Ancient Religions" Shattered Realm start
* Revamped the process by which someone can convert to a pagan (or ancient) religion. Taking the Scholarship focus will eventually prompt a "pursue ancient knowledge" event -- and, if you take it, will start a chain that can ultimately result in you gaining the cynical, mystic and/or sympathy traits...all of which are requirements for the conversion. If you don't have the Way of Life DLC, a "Seek Ancient Knowledge" decision is available to start the chain off instead.
* Separated County Conquest CB back into pagan and muslim versions. Pagan version once again has the religious authority gain/loss associated.
* Fixed crash bug on the Byzantine Empire turning into the Latin Empire.
* Byzantine Empire's flag made historically accurate

3.5.3

* Unreformed Pagans can once again declare conquests on rulers outside of their religion group
* Added properly changing CoAs for various English titles for bookmarks (mostly between Norman and Saxon), courtesy of Polskers
* Added in Afghan cultural retinues
* Restored kidnap plot
* Restored seduce plot to non-playable characters (or by those who don't have the Way of Life DLC)
* Added a small chance for a non-homosexual seduced by a homosexual to gain the homosexual trait
* Altered the "Spy On" decision available through the Way of Life DLC. It now has the following possible effects:
- it can discover plots
- if your target is also the target of your plot (or a plot you support), your plot can get extra Plot Power and will trigger more quickly
- if your target has a "real father", you can discover this and either blackmail the father or reveal the truth
- if your target has a lover, you can discover this and either blackmail either party or reveal the truth
- you can enflame a rivalry between two rulers who don't like each other
- you can reduce relations between a character and their liege
- you can spread rumors about your target
(in other words, no more free murder/kidnap/fabricate treason actions)
* Activated the kingdom versions of the later Stem Duchy titles from start so they can be formed by the player (since the holders of those duchies can't use the "new kingdom" decision)
* Creating an Empire level title should now properly require holding three kingdom level titles in addition to the holding requirement

3.5.2

* Custom Ruler DLC characters can now use the Shattered Realm decision
* Regular factions can once again be formed by the AI
* Changed War focus name to Combat since it makes far more sense.
* Fixed issue blocking some rivers from being traversed in early bookmarks
* Certain traits now effect the MTTH of Chancellor actions.
* Kingdoms created by the CM decision now brought closer inline with regular titular kingdoms

3.5.1

* Updated for WoL and 2.3
* Eu4 Converter should be functional
* Revised AI creation/joining factors for the independence faction (to compensate for culture_group bug)
* AI independence factions will no longer make demands within the first two years of the game
* Fixed transfer of prisoners in post-siege event
* Fixed Charlemagne Widukind events to take into account the Germanic religion
* Fixed Great Holy Wars from sometimes not taking land on victory
* Fixed Technology tooltips to show correct tech needed for buildings
* Removed the "Unreformed Pagan Economy" modifier
* Mongol Hordes should once again prefer to go a more historical direction when conquering
* Added AI weighting to the Holy War CB, modifying the chances the AI will use it dependant on traits
* Changed Frankish kingdoms to be creatible by the Old Frankish culture
* Changed Viking Prepared Invasion CB to require 12-50 holdings in the target kingdom (instead of 10-40)
* Event for Jylland's Prepared Invasion of Mercia now checks to ensure Mercia (or Wessex) is a valid invasion target before firing
* Changed the requirements for forming new kingdoms/empires (via the Charlemagne decision): they are more in line with forming regular titles, requiring a minimum of three lower-tier titles, but also have a hefty prestige cost.
* Reduced frequency of AI both choosing the Seduction focus as well as reduced frequency/chance of them selecting someone to seduce.
* Someone can only be seduced if they are in the same realm or relatively close to the seducer.
* Someone of the same sex, but who is not a homosexual, can be seduced by a homosexual. Their chances of success are much reduced, however, and the target cannot be made a lover.
* Overall chances of succeeding at seduction are somewhat reduced. After two rebuffs (three if you're a seducer/seductress) you cannot continue the attempt any longer.
* There is a cooldown period of one year between seductions before it can be attempted again.
* Fixed Lotharingia's capital to actually be in Lotharingia
* Shattered Realm has made its return, albeit in a different format. It is now a decision that can be enacted in the first week by players allowing creation of a randomly generated world with the option of counts, dukes or kings and standard or ancient religions
* Removed ability to ask the Pope for money, just because.

3.04.2

* Changed Norse Religion to Nordic, Saxon to Germanic
* Fix for supply limits. Added in a base supply limit boast along with a tweak to the prosperity supply limits since adding them to buildings had no effect.
* Removed requirement to be king tier from "Create Israel" decision.
* Added tooltip for creating the k_israel title to note that it must have already been created via the decision.
* Re-enabled the Frankish Empire creation if Charlemagne DLC is active.
* "Create the Carolingian Empire" decision now allows for vassals to be kings of Germany/France/Lotharingia, if the ruler is the Frankish emperor.
* Themata system for Byzantine Empire now works if emperor is Hellenic or an Orthodox heretic.
* The Byzantinue-specific coronation now only applies if emperor is Orthodox and not the Ecumenical Patriarch. Under any other circumstance, the regular coronation system applies -- but the emperor will gain the Weak Basileus or Strong Basileus trait as per normal (as opposed to the Crowned trait). In that case, the decision on which one is made by the AI rather than the Ecumenical Patriarch.
* Fix to the inability to raise tribal organization to maximum
* Opened up regular feast events to more pagan religions which don't already have their own feasts
* Added in more Jewish,Nubian and Indian Retinues
* Removed more duplicate charaters
* Corrected Seduce plot from a murder plot to an intrigue

3.04.1

* Made the zoroastrian heresies properly hidden like the others
* Fixed maintenance event so it takes feudal elective into account and doesn't switch rulers over to something else
* Kipchaks switched to Elective Gavelkind from Tanistry
* AI ambition success results no longer show timer modifier being removed
* Standardized the Charlemagne "Create Empire" and "Create Kingdom" decisions to be in-line with standard CK2+ costs
* Opened up regular coronation decision to non-Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine Empire
* Fixed seniority succession for merchant republic non-primary titles
* Tribal invasion CB no longer available to reformed pagans who are not part of a horde culture
* The 5-year restriction on Holy Wars no longer applies if you hold the targeted Duchy title or are its de jure liege. There is a text notification that tells you whether the timer will apply or not.
* Fixed temple-building event so it properly only scopes to provinces without existing temples.
* Kama now has a severe winter.
* Changed a number of provinces in Eastern Europe to tribal or to stay tribal longer.
* The Pagan Subjugation CB may now only be used against targets that are de jure part of the same kingdom as your capital. It may only be used by rulers of king tier if they hold the kingdom title being subjugated. Having the "Become a King" ambition once again allows a ruler to use the CB more than once in their lifetime, and there is a tooltip which explains this.
* Increased Muslim decadence gain and reduced low-decadence troop morale bonus
* Added prestige costs to raising tribal organization (half of the prestige requirement for the same level of crown authority, as an actual cost)
* Fixed a number of Egyptian pagan decision icons/event pictures
* Rescaled some of the initial buildings at game start, particularly for temples
* Indian players are now assigned an appropriate starting caste by the startup event
* The "Raise Tribal Army" decision now scales the resulting army based on your own maximum levies (minimum of 500, maximum of 2500), and may only be used once per month
* Independent holy orders/mercenaries who are barons no longer become vassalized to the province owner
* Courtiers of diplomacy 7+ may now attempt to convert fellow courtiers of a different religion (previously only heretics could do this). Those of a minority religion are far less likely to accept. Courtiers may only report the attempt to their liege if their intrigue is 7+ and higher than the intrigue of the converting courtier. A timer modifier is also applied so attempts cannot be spammed against the same character.
* Added in Visigoth Retinues and Cultural Buildings
* Corrected Saintonge from ocean to plains terrain
* Adjusted the way supply limits work. Certain building types and province prosperity now add to supply limit as well as high level trade post buildings
* Boosted the initial strength of the Hungarians in the Old Gods scenario.
* Added some extra checks onto the claim adventurer events to prevent them from multi-firing.
* Folded in the converter module, doesn't work yet due to issues on paradox's side.

3.04

* The Byzantine Empire must deal with 'imperial decadence', which reduces levies, taxes, and army morale...and which gets worse as the years pass. Each new emperor that takes the throne increases the decadence value, and when they're coronated the Ecumenical Patriarch decides whether they're worthy of being a 'strong basileus' or not. If they are, the decadence gets reduced, and the emperor can increase CA past low. If not, the emperor can gain the 'strong basileus' trait and also reduce their overall decadence by winning wars and gaining prestige. If the empire loses wars, their decadence will occur more rapidly.
* Arabic cultures should now have the proper settlement gfx
* Coronations now apply to titular kings/emperors as well
* Pressing claims on behalf of vassals for independent, non-de jure titles now does not result in them leaving the realm if the title is the same tier as the one they already have--it must be higher
* Added ambition for adult bastards to become legitimized--this will spawn an event, which replaces the vanilla event for being asked to legitimize a bastard. Upon the event, the bastard can be refused, can be bought off by granting them a manor (if they aren't a ruler and don't already have one), or can be legitimized.
* Bastards who would have inherited had they been legitimate will receive an event upon their younger sibling inheriting, and have the option to make a claim on the title. Vassals who like the bastard more than you may support him (an opinion bonus). If the bastard is in your court, you have the option to imprison them.
* Unknown bastards (bastard children to married mothers whose husbands thought the child was theirs) have a chance of suspecting the truth come adulthood, and may decide to approach their real father and demand to know the truth. Their real father can deny it or tell them, which will turn them into a regular bastard. They may ask to be legitimized at that time, as well.
* The Pope will single out empires who pass free investiture before it will single out kingdoms.
* Revised the way estates are dealt with upon death. One rank of estates is handed out to each legitimate son, in order of age--as cash if they are already rulers or have the maximum estates. If there are any ranks of estates remaining afterwards, they are converted into cash in order to be given to the heir.
* The Pagan/Muslim Count Conquest CB no longer adds the 5-year timer unless the user isn't victorious (either loss or white peace will add the timer).
* Pagan Subjugation CB re-added, though it can only be used once per ruler's lifetime (the Become King ambition does not ignore this). It may also only be used on neighboring realms.
* The Magyar invasion of Hungary in the 867 bookmark now properly awards prestige and wealth to the Magyar ruler upon victory. Once the Magyar ruler has distributed enough titles, many (but not all) of the event troops will vanish--"settling down" into their new homes and turning the provinces Hungarian. This will also remove the "Recently Conquered" modifier on those holdings and refill their levies. They do not get new event troops.
* The decisions to automate the handing out of baronies and counties has been revised and made more user-friendly. It now begins with a decision that explains the system. Your marshal can be moved to provinces which can be flagged to keep, and you can elect to flag only the capital holding or all holdings in the province. The decision to distribute holdings will now tell you which holdings you will be keeping. The automation now works for all gender laws, and religions assign priests of the appropriate gender and education. There is also a decision to clear the other automation decisions from your list (you can re-access it later).
* Characters with 12+ intrigue may now go into hiding/send family members into hiding during a siege for free.
* The siege events now use the new "In Hiding" trait, rather than a modifier, and there is a decision to bring everyone out of hiding once the war is over.
* Factions may now demand a reduction in tribal organization.
* Fixed tribal invasion CB -- should now work normally.
* Vassals will now react to the creation of an Antipope, either declaring support for the liege or support for the true Pope. This affects their relations with both. Those who have declared support for the true Pope are now much more attracted to the Antiking faction.
* Increased AI determination to use Restore Papacy and Depose Antipope CB's, particularly if they are zealous.
* Claimant adventurer revamp: Claimant adventurers (adventurers raising forces to take titles they have claims to) now work very differently. If they are part of the top liege's realm, they will leave immediately. They will then tour around to various independent realms, trying to campaign for suppport (coin) for their cause. Rulers may turn them away or might even take them prisoner and offer them to the targeted ruler for ransom. If they gather enough coin within three years, they will hire the force to begin the war. The size of the force depends on how much money they've raised, as well as their personal stats, and will disappear a few years after peace is attained.
* Norse religion icon replaced with the valknut.
* Added the Jus Uxoris mini-mod: it is now possible for husbands to usurp the titles of less-capable wives for titles with Gavelkind, Seniority or Primogeniture succession--provided the husband is himself capable and of an appropriate culture/religion. This uses a plot, and once enough support is gained it spawns an event chain where the wife may try to seek help from a relative or friend--failing that, the husband will take their titles. Note that these titles cannot be given away to anyone other than children, or the wife will re-inherit. Also, if no living sons exist by the time either the wife or husband dies, the titles revert (yes, even to the wife if she dies, thus passing to her heir instead of the husband's). The titles also revert to the wife if they divorce.
* Turned mood faction events into notification-only, for now.
* Fixed bankruptcy events sometimes firing for players when they take over an AI character.
* Tribal rulers (who cannot build holdings) will occasionally have priest courtiers {particularly zealous and/or ambitious ones) and the same culture/religion set out to build a temple in a province that doesn't already have one, which is also of the same culture/religion, and which has space available. This can take anywhere up to 20 years, depending on how much money the courtier has, and they may encounter problems along the way which will require the ruler to bail them out or the project fails (unless they have their own coin to cover it). Should they die or otherwise abandon their quest, it's possible for the ruler to put another in his place so long as he has sufficient coin and a priest available.

3.03.1

* Steam Workshop upload
* Non-feudal kingdoms can now change CA again
* Fixed the Crowned and Uncrowned trait icons for Linux systems
* Added some random dynasties for the proto-Russian and Arberian cultures
* Upon reforming the Roman Empire, the emperor can change to Roman culture after ruling for 5 years
* Children no longer engage in the Hellenic cults

3.03

* Pretender factions now issue an ultimatum to the ruler rather than instantly declaring war.
* In a pretender war, the other vassals are individually asked to support the claimant rather than it being up to the faction leaders.
* The AI will not start a pretender war until it is at least at 75% faction strength, but now does not require any additional supporters if it has enough strength on its own.
* Jewish refugees should be slightly more reliable in their appearance.
* Fixed dynasties for Sardinian and Galloway rulers.
* Switched the locations of Tregor and Porhoet.
* Navarra now begins the game as Pamplona, switching to Navarra in 1076 (there is an event to switch the name in-game).
* Players may now choose to voluntarily call faction meetings without waiting for the event to prompt it.
* Restored the proper faction icons.
* Rewards to supporters after a civil war now specifically only penalize rulers who opposed the rulers or those who consciously elected to remain neutral -- not those who did not get a chance to decide (because they were imprisoned or incapable) or who otherwise did not receive the choice event. Penalties for those who remained neutral are roughly half the penalties applied to those who opposed the ruler.
* Added a Treaty of Meerssen event chain, should the Carolingian emperor inherit both Lotharingia and Burgundy. The rulers of West Francia and East Francia will demand a redistribution of the lands.
* After the Carolingian Empire's dissolution, the ruler of East Francia receives an Carolingian Reconquest CB on the HRE's de jure territory, provided they control less than 100 provinces.
* Added a maintenance event to remove the patron deities from those who convert away from hinduism
* All non-tribal kings and emperors are now "uncrowned" prior to holding a coronation event -- whereupon they become "crowned" (or "crowned by the pope", in the case of the HRE and Carolingian Empire) and are able to change crown laws. Being uncrowned also means their title can still be claimed via weak claims, even if they're an adult male. The coronation event is an event chain in itself, starting with invitations to the event (which go out to those in the realm as well as allies and neighboring rulers of your religion) as well as a great feast that follows.
* Fixed "Weaken Fellow Vassal" plot so the results do not break when your liege is not also your top liege.
* Fixed crash bug caused by AI-led angry faction being strong enough to present demands to the liege, but having no valid demands, and ending up in a loop.
* Tweaked calculations for vassals separating from the Carolingian Empire. Also changed requirements for forming the HRE: it cannot be the former emperor, and they must have either 100 provinces or 10 East Francia duchies.
* Kings and emperors who have 3 or more king titles in a low Crown Authority realm may get a duke demanding one of the titles be turned over to them. This only occurs when the king or emperor has not yet been coronated, is incapable, or is the prisoner of that duke. The king/emperor has the option of turning the title over to a random child, pretender, or claimant instead. If the title is turned over, the king/emperor will retain only a weak claim on it.

3.02.0

* expanded Carolingian Empire in 867 to its actual borders
* whenever the Carolingian title changes hands, provided it's at low or no CA, there's a chance that disaffected vassals will declare independence. They are less likely to do so if closely related to the new emperor or of the same dynasty. If the resulting empire becomes too small, then the Carolingian Empire disbands and the title becomes inactive -- opening up creation of the HRE.
* restored the king titles of Lotharingia, Italy, and Burgundy for the 867 start, which weren't being used
* added setup event for Carolingian Empire in 867 to simulate the rivalries between the kings in the empire
* made Sardinia its own de jure kingdom separate from Italy
* added an austerity system for the AI, so under certain conditions (has a loan, at war with a stronger enemy, has a king or duchy title they are eligible to form) they will be restricted from spending money on lesser expenses like buildings or events; when the AI is saving up, they will hit up vassals for money in the same manner as if they were bankrupt; the AI will now only take loans if they are at war with someone who has a higher title, any of their realm provinces are occupied, they are at negative wealth, or they are saving up for an important expense
* updated pardon decision so it properly removes all execute/imprison opinion modifiers
* added proto-Russian cultures into 867 bookmark provinces
* hopefully found instances where a character could become their own lover and removed them

* basque women with weak claims can have their claim enforced on a title under the Kingdom of Nevarra even if the current ruler is not a woman or has a regent
* norse pagan women may lead armies and become marshals if they possess the shield maiden trait
* revision to faction system:
- faction meetings and pretender/separatist ultimatums no longer performed when the faction leader is at war
- baron-tier vassals now permitted to join factions if they are feudal or possess more than one barony title--they may not create factions, however
- a ruler cannot lead a faction if there is a higher-tiered ruler also in the faction, not unless that ruler has previously been removed from leadership
- faction votes are not equal: baron-tier faction members get 1 vote, count-tier faction members get 2 votes, duke-tier faction members get 4 votes, king-tier faction members get 8 votes
- non-aligned rulers can no longer join a rebellion if they are imprisoned or incapable
- fixed a bug so the system will better properly evaluate the rebel power potential of factions

3.01.0

* expanded Carolingian Empire in 867 to its actual borders
* whenever the Carolingian title changes hands, provided it's at low or no CA, there's a chance that disaffected vassals will declare independence. They are less likely to do so if closely related to the new emperor or of the same dynasty. If the resulting empire becomes too small, then the Carolingian Empire disbands and the title becomes inactive -- opening up creation of the HRE.
* restored the king titles of Lotharingia, Italy, and Burgundy for the 867 start, which weren't being used
* added setup event for Carolingian Empire in 867 to simulate the rivalries between the kings in the empire
* made Sardinia its own de jure kingdom separate from Italy
* added an austerity system for the AI, so under certain conditions (has a loan, at war with a stronger enemy, has a king or duchy title they are eligible to form) they will be restricted from spending money on lesser expenses like buildings or events; when the AI is saving up, they will hit up vassals for money in the same manner as if they were bankrupt; the AI will now only take loans if they are at war with someone who has a higher title, any of their realm provinces are occupied, they are at negative wealth, or they are saving up for an important expense

* added proto-Russian cultures into 867 bookmark provinces

- If a faction overthrows a child ruler or a ruler with a child heir, that ruler's primary titles will now be distributed among the rebels according to claims and de-jure claims.

Faction leaders who are self-serving or fail to get their agenda through may be thrown out and replaced by a new leader (decided by order of joining the faction).

- Hamburg now starts as a duke-tier merchant republic.

- Retired the various No X modules and added a new 'Hardcore Mode' module. Default CK2+ now has higher income, higher demesne sizes and faster claims fabrication. Hardcore mode lowers your income, slows expansion and gives you a smaller demesne and unhappier factions among other effects. It is meant to appeal to players who want slower expansion and a more challenging game. This change replaces the default difficulty setting, which no longer has an effect.

1.33.12:

- Restored events for Knights Templar and Knights of St. John to build castles.

- Just about everything that gives you cause to revoke someone's title now also gives you cause to execute them - but don't expect their immediate family to be happy about it.
- Faction mood changes due to events and decisions should now be applied within a few days of the event, instead of at the next maintenance pulse.
- Grand Tournament now requires you to have reigned for 5 years, to make it less of a faction pacifier on succession.
- Shattered World easter egg dynasties will no longer show up in the regular scenario.
- Succession laws of secondary titles will now always be set to the same as the primary title, even for Kingdoms and above.
- The AI will now change gender succession laws when appropriate.
- Vassal opinion from raised levies will now drop faster, to correspond with the faster pace of wars in CK2+.
- Reworked the way succession law changes work to prevent any unintentional loss of prestige or opinion impacts when creating titles. This is purely a backend change and players should not notice anything being different.
- Updated to the latest version of Culturally Different Cities.
- Vassals who choose to keep the lands gained in a Crusade will now relinquish all their old titles to their liege.
- Choosing to keep the lands gained in a Crusade for yourself will now give you the relevant titles and holy truce modifier, just as if you gave it to a relative.
- All feudal lords with some participation score in a successful Crusade now have the option to request a county in the captured Crusade lands for a landless relative who is not their primary heir. Any characters granted counties this way will get a large opinion boost with their new liege.
- Crusader states will now start with High CA, both to make them stronger and to prevent their lands from being inherited back.
- Fixed various minor bugs and typos.

1.32.34:
- Fixed various bugs and typos detected with validator.
- Fixed various bugs with the new demesne laws where the mood effects would be incorretly applied.
- The 'Crown Levy Privileges' law will now only give maximum amount of troops allowed by size and laws instead of always giving 100%.

1.32.33:
- Changed the Tyrant trait tooltip to make it clearer that tyranny is a points system and that Tyrant can represent anything from 5 to 100 points of tyranny.
- When a ruler with Lifetime Appointments dies or is forced to abdicate, the whole council will now be dismissed, allowing the new ruler to appoint a new council.
- A ruler with Lifetime Appointments can now dismiss the Court Chaplain if said Court Chaplain is a different religion.
- Added a workaround for a vanilla problem that was breaking the Lifetime Appointments law.
- Vassals will no longer demand changes in Tax/Levy Privileges if their liege does not qualify for those laws (they are only available to Kings and up).

1.32.32:
- Increased the innate tech bonus on temples from 10% to 20%.
- Fixed a bug where changing succession laws while holding multiple primary titles would result in extreme relation drops.
- Added new titles for all levels/types of Jewish rulers, created by Necroskowitz.
- Added the 'Council Terms' demesne law group. This law allows you to set councillor appointments to last for life, which will make the Court Faction happy.
- Added the 'Levy Privileges' demesne law group. This law allows you to grant your vassals the right to decide how many troops they will raise for you (based on opinion) or force them to raise up to the maximum required by law.
- Added the 'Tax Privileges' demesne law group. This law allows you to grant your vassals the right to raise additional taxes at the expense of your own revenues, grant yourself the right to raise additional taxes at the expense of your vassals, or set tax levels at the same for both vassals and liege.
- Removed the vassal opinion penalties for demesne laws and replaced them with faction mood bonuses/maluses, so Crown Tax Privileges and High Feudal Taxes will anger the Princely faction, for example.
- Reworked demesne taxation laws. They are now simplified down to 3 steps, each step representing 20% taxation of cities/temples or 10% taxation on feudal vassals.
- Removed demesne levy laws.
- Changed default CA to Autonomous because of a vanilla bug where default CA law set anywhere other than Autonomous would cause a CA reset on religious conversion.
- Independent barons who do not hold a higher level title of any kind will now automatically become vassals of their de jure liege, as the AI seems to not understand how to press de jure barony claims.
- You can no longer request Duchy titles from your liege if he or she has demesne provinces in that Duchy (to prevent rather silly things like the Counts of Bornholm always being given the whole of Skåne over time).
- All CBs should now work properly with the Win a War ambition.

1.32.31:
- Maimed characters are now more suspectible to illness.
- Non-cultural retinues now have small offensive and defensive bonuses to both their unit types, to make them more competetive with cultural retinues.
- Gender Equality no longer sets Muslim titles to Cognatic, as lack of matrilineal marriages makes them unplayable.
- The Ecumenical Patriarch is now properly the Orthodox head of religion in Greece and Anatolia.

1.32.30:
- Fixed a bug where a faction war to depose would lower CA two steps instead of one.
- Fixed a bug that was causing vassals that broke away in an independence war to be immediately revassalized.

1.32.29:
- If a ruler is toppled in a pretender revolt, any non-dejure vassals they control will now automatically be transfered to the pretender.
- If a ruler is overthrown by a revolt, any non-contingent (enclave or island) non-dejure vassals that are not affected by at least Low crown authority will now automatically become independent.
- Fixed some bugs where characters would not get properly flagged as rebels during faction revolts, and would end up being penalized upon victory.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes changing succession laws would not cost prestige.

1.32.28:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking random claims in Shattered World under some circumstances.

1.32.27:
- Removed a test decision that was accidentally left in 1.32.26.
- Fixed some bugs with the Shattered World scenario.

1.32.26:
- Forming the Latin Empire now only requires Constantinople, but the title will be lost if the holder loses Constantinople.
- Characters who are released from prison due to being blinded or castrated should now automatically be pardoned of any righteous imprisonment causes.
- Illness and Pneumonia can now develop into blindness.
- Raised the base health of characters but increased the health penalties of illnesses, to try and cut down on early natural deaths.
- Added two new optional modules, 'No De Jure Drift' which turns off de jure drift and 'No Drift & No Assaults' which turns off both de jure drift and assaults. You should only use one of the 'No X' modules at any given time.
- A failed murder or kidnapping attempt that aborts the plot will now make that character immune to the same kind of plot for five years.
- Ruler designer Immortal trait should now work correctly.

1.32.25:
- If a child ruler is deposed in a faction revolt, the faction leader will now assume the throne.
- Vassal rulers can now only get random claims inside their realm.
- You will now be notified when another ruler receives a random claim to one of your titles.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Separatist factions from forming.
- Added a new alternative scenario with its own module, 'Divided Muslims', courtesy of zeress. Scenario modules now have their own special tag, and a maximum of one scenario module should be used at any given time.
- More fixes and tweaks to the faction system.
- Female characters are now treated equally for the purposes of pressing claims and succession wars under the Gender Equality module.
- You will no longer be expected to reward supporters in minor civil wars (such as a single vassal revolting).

1.32.24:
- Fixed a very bad bug where a successful excommunication war would result in the attacking ruler abdicating.
- Separatist sentiment now spreads faster in areas distant from the capital, so that large blobs are more prone to collapse.

1.32.23:
- Added a workaround that should revassalize vassals who become independent as a result of a rebellion becoming invalid within a month or so of the war being invalidated.
- Fixed a number of minor bugs detected by validator.
- Restored the fix for immortal trait not working from character designer, since the Paradox fix apparently didn't take.
- Rulers can now once again 'go native' as a result of living in a province with a culture not too different from their own (German characters are likely to become Dutch, but aren't going to become Turkish, for example). This should greatly cut down on minority cultures being wiped out over the progress of the game.
- Non-contingent territories (exclaves and islands) will now be much more inclined towards separatism (culture and religion still factor in majorly, though).
- The AI will now prioritize forming contingent territories when waging holy war.
- Increased the prestige cost for unjustified revocation of titles.
- Characters who are revolting against their liege due to a title revocation or imprisonment will now attempt to call in the rest of the realm.
- Characters who are not a member of a faction will now get called into revolts, although they are unlikely to pick sides unless they either strongly like or dislike their liege.

1.32.22:
- Added an experimental possible fix for the 'characers dying on abdication' bug.
- Fixed some more bugs with starting before 1066.
- The AI is now much more keen to switch out of Gavelkind in Shattered World and Reign of Princes.
- Fixed some titles that were unintentionally made createable by anyone (such as the Hansa).

1.32.21:
- Fixed a bug that was making close relatives in your court marry without your permission.
- Fixed a bug where an AI-only decision was accidentally available to players.
- Using a start date before 1066 will no longer break the mod.

1.32.20:
- Fixed a bug where AI mercenaries would not get disbanded after war because they had lost their regimental earmark.

1.32.19:
- Fixed minor bugs and mistakes with Shattered World and Reign of Princes.
- Separatist revolts will no longer call in the other factions to the war.
- The AI will no longer blind prisoners unless it is in the Byzantine culture group. The option is still available to players.

1.32.18:
- Pagans now use Muslim CoA shapes, though with non-Muslim CoAs, to make them visually distinct from both Christians and Muslims on the map.
- Added a new 'Reign of Princes' scenario to the Alternative Scenarios module. This scenario builds on Shattered World, dividing the world into mostly Duchy-sized independent states, with a smattering of Theocracies, Republics and (mostly titular) Kingdoms. It adds a number of new titles that are only available within this scenario.
- The first generation of rulers in Shattered World will now get a special trait that greatly encourages the AI to expand heedless of risk.
- Reduced the required realm size to form an empire from 200 to 150.
- The Aztec title will no longer be disbanded from having too few holdings.
- Byzantium will now never be disbanded from having too few holdings as long as it still holds Constantinople.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the Aztecs from using the Tribal Invasion CB.
- El Cid is now the Count of Zaragoza in Shattered World.
- You should no longer get the 'Lack of Ambition' penalties when you have aborted an ambition until you are able to pick another.

1.32.17:
- The decision to blind prisoners is now available to everyone, though the AI will rarely use it unless in the Byzantine culture group.
- The decision to castrate prisoners is now also available to Muslims.
- Kiev no longer starts as a Kingdom in 1066, but is set to have existed in the previous generation to prevent the Russian Dukes from having claims on each other.
- Increased the de jure land of Kiev to prevent it from being immediately reformed.
- Further increased likelyhood of Separatist movements forming.
- A rebellious faction that does not take another action should now declare war to depose their liege within a few years of becoming rebellious.
- Reduced the average size of the Mongol starting stacks (they can still start with very large armies, its just less likely).
- Fixed a bug causing other factions not being called into faction wars to depose.
- Faction revolts should now occur a bit faster.

1.32.16:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking Lower Crown Authority civil wars.

1.32.15:
- Tweaked the faction relations formula to work better in large realms.
- Changed the way faction moods work. Instead of trending upwards or downwards over time, the mood will be set each maintenance pulse depending on the relevant factors such as relations and faction goals, meaning that factions will be much quicker to respond to changes in the realm. Effects that give faction mood from events and decisions will add a temporary mood modifier that 'bleeds off' over time.
- Increased the chance of separatist factions forming (it was set at far too low).
- Fixed some bugs with the negative consequenses event for trying to sow dissent.

1.32.14:
- Various fixes and tweaks to the faction system.
- Fixed a bug where a faction leader declaring to lower CA would not bring his faction with him.
- Pretender revolts will now attempt to call in the other factions when declaring war.

- A faction who ends up with their liege as a member due to the liege remaining in faction on inheritance bug will now disband and reform to correct the problem.
- Increased the impact of tactics to add unpredicability to battles and make it less of a numbers game.

1.32.13:
- Added new graphical icons to the faction mood modifiers, to make them more immediately obvious.
- New french translation courtesy of Faelron.
- Fixed a bug where playing with the Gender Equality module would result in prestige loss on starting up the game.

1.32.12:
- Fixed a bug that was preventing separatist movements from forming.
- Relatives who are denied estates should no longer be able to retake the ambition and ask again.
- Women can now properly be granted titles under Gender Equality. However, you will be unable to change your succession laws for the first ruler you play with using the module. There is no way around this that I know of.
- Fixed a bug where the wrong country would get the Aztec army spawned for them.
- You are no longer allowed to fabricate evidence of heresy against your vassals (as this allowed for exploits with the free imprisonment/ransom).

1.32.11:
- Fixed a bug that was preventing claimant factions from gaining support.

1.32.10:
- Vassals in small realms will now tend to consolidate into fewer factions so they can better match their liege in strength.
- The Princely, Religious and Court factions can now declare war to overthrow their liege if angered.
- Separatist sentiment will now spread more evenly in the realm as a result of angry factions. This should result in more sensible independence revolts.
- Fixed a bug where an AI vassal would try to join multiple factions simultaneously.
- Tweaked AI faction picking priorities.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal inheriting their liege's title would result in them in them remaining in their old (lower level) faction.
- Claimants should now have an easier time gaining backing from unhappy factions.
- Reduced the size of Harold Godwinsson's starting army (some wonky math made it far too large).
- Separatist movements should now take more time to build strength before declaring war.

1.32.9:
- Fixed another major broken scope issue.

1.32.8:
- The Immortal trait is once again available in the ruler designer (it was accidentally taken out).
- Fixed a major issue with bad scopes in factions introduced in 1.32.7.

1.32.7:
- Fixed some more problems with the Aztec invasion events.
- Dukes will no longer have a Princely faction as they are unable to meet most of their demands. They still have the Court, Republican and Religious factions.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal revolting against a liege that was not independent would cause some issues with the factions of their liege's liege.
- After a successful independence war, both sides will now greatly dislike each other to prevent re-vassalization.

1.32.5:
- Councillor job events should now fire properly for female councillors with the Gender Equality module.
- Fixed some minor bugs with faction mood notification events.
- Increased the likelyhood of separatist movements forming.
- Fixed a bug where factions would declare war to reduce CA in a realm that was already at autonomous vassals.

1.32.4:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the Aztec invasion. For the fix to work correctly you will need to play a new game or use a save from before the Aztecs invade.
- The Princely Faction 'more levies' event should now work correctly.

1.32.3:
- Reduced the frequency of random claims.
- Increased the speed at which faction moods change and lowered the MTTH of many faction related events.
- Fixed a bug that caused some randomly created characters to get the immortal trait.

1.32.2:
- Fixed a bug where the 'end of tournament' event would fire repeatedly and endlessly.

1.32.1:
- You will now get a severe penalty to general opinion and prestige for being a member of multiple 'main' factions (so you can be a member of the Princely Faction and a Separatist, but you get a penalty if you're in both the Princely and Court factions).
- Fixed a duplicate succession law issue in the Gender Equality module.
- The Count of Napoli no longer starts as a duke in Shattered World.
- A successful independence war will no longer result in the defeated liege gaining claims on the revolters.

1.32:
- Now compatible with 1.08 and Sunset Invasion.
- Completely reworked the faction system. There are now four more-or-less permanent factions, each serving the interests of a particular group in your realm. For example, the Princely Faction looks after the interests of the high aristocracy, and want low CA and a weak liege, while the Religious Faction wants holy wars and a pious liege. Factions have moods ranging from Happy to Angry, and will help or hinder their liege depending on their mood. An unhappy or angry faction might demand changes in the crown laws, back a pretender, or even start an independence movement if relations deteriorate far enough. To keep the factions happy, you will need to look after their goals and maintain good relations with the members - relations with faction leaders are especially important. For more information on a specific faction's goals, mouseover the faction's name in the faction screen. To see a faction's mood, look at the character modifiers of its leader.
- The 'Sow Dissent' chancellor action now works by reducing the relations between the targeted province's owner and all their count and above level vassals. This should make it much simpler and more useful in general.
- It is now possible (but rare) for non martially educated characters to pick up leader traits in battle.
- Increased the prestige cost for attacking an ally.
- You now need 200 realm holdings to form an empire, up from 100.
- Titular empires that drop below 100 holdings will now disband, up from 75.
- Removed the 'No Time Limit' optional module. No Time Limit is now on by default.
- Added a new 'Gender Equality' optional module. This module allows women to serve on any position in the council and sets all titles to Cognatic succession.
- Independent female rulers can now lead armies. The AI will avoid doing so unless their martial score is high.
- By default, the Aztec invasion will now happen roughly 1 out of 10 games. You can use the 'Vanilla Aztecs' optional module to make them appear every game. They will only ever appear if you have Sunset Invasion installed and activated.
- Added a decision to summon your children to your court, if they are currently the subjects of a different, lower-ranked court.
- Changed back to vanilla education after running several tests that showed that skills and stats decline over time because of the AI's inability to understand the CK2+ education system.
- Added a character decision to pardon characters who you have rightful imprisonment against as a result of plotting, murder of treason. This will remove any such rightful imprisonment causes and increase their opinion of you.
- You can now execute characters who are caught plotting, murdering or kidnapping without getting tyranny.
- The mod will now load instantly on game startup, thanks to the magic of the character history effect scope.
- Added a generic decision to give money to charity in exchange for piety for characters that don't have access to indulgences or Sadaqah.
- Removed the Duchy Conquest CB, as the original reason for it (Muslim realm collapse) is long since gone. Instead, fabricating claims is now easier, especially in Shattered World.
- Tweaked the Fourth Crusade scenario. Byzantium now ceases to exist on the Latin Empire start date, and is instead replaced by the Despotate of Nicaea, who start with a claim to the Latin Empire.
- Any Orthodox character who takes over the Latin Empire will now immediately gain Byzantium (and lose the Latin Empire) if Byzantium does not already have a holder. If Byzantium has a holder, the Latin Empire will simply be destroyed.
- Byzantium should no longer be immediately destroyed due to small size in the late scenarios.
- The Ottomans are no longer an Empire level title.
- The AI will no longer carry out plots that they have no ability to succeed with, such as fabricating claims.
- Plots should now properly show up in the intrigue screen when conditions are right.
- You are no longer allowed to kidnap rulers unless they are a vassal of yours, to prevent some exploits with it and wars.

1.13.14:
- Fixed another bug where characters could end up with random claims on distant titles.

1.31.13:
- Fixed a bug where plots would not complete properly.

1.31.12:
- Fixed a bug where characters could end up with random claims on distant titles.
- Fixed some minor localisation errors.

1.31.11:
- Fixed a bug where you would be unable to complete the same plot twice with the same character due to bad flag cleanup.
- Fixed a bug where plots would abort incorrectly or count as having succeeded despite failing them due to bad flags.
- It is no longer possible to declare war while hosting a grand tournament, to prevent the AI from aborting its own tournaments.
- Tweaked the 'Fabricate Evidence of Treason' plot events to make more sense when targeting your own vassal.
- Children and young characters will now get traits to reflect their age. Young characters get a reduction to their stats and the respect of their vassals due to inexperience, but a bonus to health, fertility and sex appeal.
- The AI should now be significantly more aggressive, especially in the Shattered World scenario.
- Fixed a bug where the random claim event could give you a claim on a Duchy without a holder.
- The Restore the Papacy CB is no longer available in the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.10:
- All provinces in Shattered World should now have a playable count. There may be a handful of Lowborn characters still holding counties who are not playable - please report them as you find them.
- The AI should now get considerably more random claims in Shattered World.
- Fixed some minor database bugs.

1.31.9:
- Fixed a bug that was causing some rebellion wars as a result of imprisonment to end inconclusively.

1.31.8:
- Fixed misaligned CoAs.

1.31.7:
- Fixed a save game incompatability issue.
- Fixed a bug where the Duchy Conquest CB would be available to Christians outside of the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.6:
- Fixed numerous database issues in the hopes of addressing crashes in 1.31.5.
- Fixed a bug where a Crusade ending in White Peace would lead to a MA boost for the attacker.
- Integrated the new faction-related events tied to the 'Scheme' spymaster job.
- Fixed a bug where commanders could pick up an unlimited number of combat traits.
- All religions can now use Duchy Conquest in the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.5:
- Fixed some history file bugs.
- Fixed the numbering in the .mod file.

1.31.4:
- Updated for 1.07b.
- The amount of money taken in embezzlement is now scaled to rank (50 for count, 75 for duke, 100 for king/emperor)
- Fixed a bug that would cause repeated crusades against Byzantium after a failed 'Fourth Crusade' scenario.

1.31.3:
- Reduced the frequency of AI plots.
- Plots will now generally fire a bit faster, to make it harder to detect and quash every single plot.
- Fixed some bugs with the Get Married ambition.
- Eunuchs should no longer be able to take lovers or procreate.
- Increased the amount of money taken in an embezzle plot, as well as the chances of success.
- Tweaked factions to be slower to form, but faster to get membership under favorable circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where characters would get imprisoned in wars they were not a participant in.
- Fixed further bugs with CBs and ambitions.

1.31.2:
- Fixed some further bugs with CBs.

- Fixed a bug where the pentarchies were not working correctly.
- Fixed some problems with religions being assigned the wrong icons.

1.31:
- Updated to 1.07 and Legacy of Rome.
- The mod should now be much faster to start up once the game gets going (less lag).
- It is no longer possible to start a faction or declare war until the mod has started up (should occur within a week of starting date).
- Removed the Imperial Reconquest CB.
- There is no longer a difference between a realm's offensive and defensive levies (as this plays havoc with LoR's power calculation systems). The base levies for large decentralized realms were increased somewhat.
- Retired several mechanics made redundant by LoR, such as the regency trait, the civil war system and the genetics system. Future versions will work on expanding the faction system, incorporating some of the ideas from the cut civil war system.
- Retired the BLC module, as it was incompatible with the many character graphics changes in 1.07.

1.30.3:
- It is now possible to imprison characters in war as a result of taking control of the holdings where they are located.
- Fixed a 'gap' in the new levies system where realms of a particular size (~90 holdings) would get almost no levies.
- It is now possible to legitimize bastards of your dynasty as long as you are their direct liege, even if they are not your child.
- Added the Kingdoms of Northumbria and Wessex as Anglo-Saxon alternatives to Mercia (not createable if you are already a King).

1.30.1:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking Holy Wars unless you had very high piety.

1.30:
- Fixed a bug where a revolt that did not trigger a civil war could cause weird out-of-realm usurpations if successful.
- Fixed a bug where titular Elective titles would be unable to change succession laws properly.
- Vassals who are married to their liege's sibling, child or parent will now get an opinion bonus towards their liege, so that you can use marriage alliances to make your vassals more loyal.
- Creating the Israel title will now activate and vassalize a Jewish holy order.
- Increased the tax bonus for very small (1 or 2 county) demesnes.
- You can now declare war to force-vassalize an indepedent ruler whose titles are all de jure vassals of yourself or one of your vassals. Medium or higher CA is required to subjugate de jure vassals of a King or Empire title.
- Reworked the levy system. The amount of levies you can raise from your vassals is now based on three factors: Realm size (total number of holdings in your realm), crown authority and whether or not you are fighting a defensive/civil war. The smaller your realm, the more base troops you will be able to call on, and the less important crown authority becomes, while a very large realm with autonomous vassals (for example the HRE) will be very weak on the offensive. Together with the small demesne tax bonus, this is meant to make having a small demesne / lots of counts as a vassal or a small realm a viable strategy.
- Added the province of Sinkat in Abyssinia.
- Totally reworked duchy/county colors to give them their own distinct coloration instead of 'regional' colors, to make independent states and politically divided areas stand out more and make the direct vassal / duchy de jure mapmodes easier to interpret.
- Turned off the my documents user directory once again as it was causing loadup crashes for some users.
- Holy Wars and Duchy Conquests will now once again usurp the Duchy title, if it is held by either the target or one of their vassals.

1.29.2:
- Fixed a problem with the Mongols that was making their scripted armies vanish.
- Rebels will no longer declare independence immediately upon taking control of a province, but rather after several months of uncontested control of it.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the new plot icons not to appear.

1.29.1:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking many of the new plots.

1.29:
- CK2+ now has its own user folder in My Documents (since they seem to work without nuking your message settings now).
- The Kingdoms of Saxony, Bavaria and Frisia are now de jure HRE.
- You can no longer create, usurp, or be granted Duchy and above level titles during war, to prevent various bugs and AI problems.
- Merged the Kingdom of Muscowy into Novgorod and Kiev.
- Added the de jure Duchy of Latium.
- Merged Ancona and Spoleto into Spoleto.
- Added the titular duchy-tier Republics of Bologna, San Marino and Ancona.
- Increased prestige requirements for raising crown authority.
- You now need high CA to freely revoke infidels.
- An independent player bordering the Il-Khanate or Golden Horde will now be given the chance to swear fealty and pay tribute to the Mongols rather than being invaded. This option only occurs once, and only before the Horde in question settles (converts religion).
- Fixed a bug that caused persistent crashes when starting a game after 1244.
- Significantly tweaked the de jure borders of Byzantium and surrounding territories. Wallachia, Epirus and Trebizond are now de jure Kingdoms, while Thessalonica is a titular Kingdom only createable by Catholics, similar to Cyprus.
- Characters with a small demesne (less than 4 holdings) will now get a tax bonus (50% at 1 demesne, 25% at 2 and 10% at 3), to encourage the creation of more counts and make single-province counts more fun to play.
- Loyalists and Rebels in a civil war are now distinguished by the 'Loyalist' and 'Rebel' traits, which will be properly transfered to their heir if they die during the civil war.
- AI vassals may now attempt a bid for independence if the realm is already in a civil war they are not a part of.
- You can now press Kingdom De Jure claims on behalf of vassals (as long as their Kingdom has Medium or higher CA).
- You can now declare De Jure claims for Duchies that you either control all the counties in, or whose (Medium or higher CA) King or Empire title you hold.
- Added six new plots: Discredit Councillor, Embezzle from Liege, Instigate Revolt, Kidnap Character, Fabricate Claims of Treason and Accuse of Heresy.
- Added some additional checks that should hopefully prevent cultural melting pots from spreading where they shouldn't.
- Added a workaround for characters with estates not getting income. They will now get a yearly sum of money equal to their estates income.
- Fixed a bug where a character who had murdered another character through plot would be unable to ever do so again because of a flag that did not clear.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal demanding a title to stay loyal would revolt even if given the title.
- Fixed a bug where revolters would almost never declare independence at the end of a civil war because of some logic problems.
- Rebel titles will no longer make use of the dynastic title naming system.
- Fixed a bug where a marshal's ability to suppress revolts was inversely proportional to his skill.
- Cleaned up the landed CoA folder, getting rid of many off-center flags and reducing the overall size of the mod considerably.
- Shifted de jure borders of Abyssinia to prevent some undesirable usurpations.
- Fixed a bug where a pagan ruler converting through the missionary events would not also convert their children.
- Fixed an exploit where a player supporter of the rebel side in a civil war could avoid punishment by switching lieges mid-war. Even if you do switch lieges, you will now still be imprisoned with a revoke reason upon the defeat of the rebels.
- The defending side in a civil war will now get more prestige for winning than they would for defeating a regular revolt.
- Increased decadence gain from random events.
- Fixed a bug that caused the rebel leader in a civil to sometimes get a big prestige hit.
- It is now easier for vassals to rally support for a civil war in a large realm.
- Opinion of liege now matters more when determining whether to join the rebel side in a civil war, and opinion of rebel leader a bit less.
- Added some AI tweaks that should hopefully make the AI more willing to take on foes their own size.
- Crusades/Jihads are now called by the liege of the head of religion, if the head of religion is a vassal (the head of religion's piety is still used in determening when a Jihad can be called).
- Reduced base income from temple and city holdings.
- Decreased impact of tax levels on opinion for city and temple vassals.
- Burgundy is now a de jure part of the HRE.
- Waging Duchy Conquests on other Muslims will now increase decadence.
- Only independent Muslims and Pagans are now allowed to wage Duchy Conquests.
- Vassals who are engaged in their own wars can no longer pick sides in a civil war, to prevent some issues related to vassals in a civil war joining in a higher level civil war.
- Enabled Ethiopian and Nubian mercenaries for all non-Muslim faiths (so Semien can hire mercs).

1.28.4:
- Fixed a major bug where any character in the game could get events for possessed characters.
- Rulers who are part of the rebel side in a civil war can no longer declare their own wars until the civil war is resolved.

1.28.3:
- Fixed a major bug with civil wars that was causing vassals who pledged their support to the rebels early on not to join the war.

1.28.2:
- Fixed a bug that was massively inflating AI loan sizes on higher difficulties.
- The AI will now take loans to create King titles, to encourage their more frequent creation.
- Fixed a bug where you would be unable to declare a sanctioned holy war unless you had enough piety for an unsanctione one.
- Fixed several minor bugs with civil wars.
- Eased up on AI requirements to switch out of Seniority since it is a difficulty enough law to switch out of even for a player.
- Added decisions to convert to your capital's culture and religion (for players only).
- De Jure Emperors will now lose their Emperor title if their realm size drops below 50 (compared to 75 for titular Emperors).

1.28.1:
- Fixed various bugs with civil wars where defeated rebels would not be properly imprisoned or end up as a vassal of the wrong liege.
- Fixed a bug where vassals who declared independence after a civil war would incorrectly be given tax privileges.

1.28:
- Reduced frequency of second wives asking to be first wife.
- Reduced the alarming frequency of Muslim wives stabbing each other to death (I don't think life in the harem was quite this violent historically).
- Fixed a bug that was making the Mongol scripted armies disappear prematurely.
- Implemented a brand new civil war system. When a vassal revolts against their liege, he or she will now attempt to rally support for a civil war among the other vassals. If at least 33% of the liege's other vassals (measured in controlled provinces) support the rebellion, then a civil war begins. In a civil war, the leading rebel (original attacker) takes on a special rebel title of equivalent rank to his or her liege, and vassalizes all other rebels, allowing the revolters to fight as a unified realm. Vassals in the civil war who do not side with the rebels can either support their liege (allowing him or her to draw more troops from them), stay neutral, or demand titles they have de jure claims on in exchange for their support. Civil wars break down into two categories: Wars to depose (depose liege, war against tyranny and revolt against rule) and succession wars against liege. In a successful civil war to depose, the liege will be overthrown and most of his or her titles divided among the rebels according to de jure pretensions. In a successful succession civil war, the pretender will take all primary (or King and above) level titles from the old liege. Either way, a successful civil war also allows non-dejure vassals and vassals under very low crown authority to break away and declare independence. Finally, at the end of a civil war, regardless of which side won, the winner(s) will be expected to reward their supporters at the expense of themselves and the neutrals and losers, and all vassals supporting the losing side will be imprisoned by the winning side with valid reasons to revoke - so be careful about picking sides!
- If a player dies with tyranny, their heir will now inherit all but 10 levels of said tyranny (so if the dead character had 20 tyranny, his heir will get 10 on taking the throne).
- Reduced the duration of the bubonic plague, as some players were reporting apocalyptic-level outbreaks.
- Increased salaries from offices and honorary titles. A single-province count that is councillor to an emperor will now almost double his income (note that office incomes still won't show up in your budget screen - this is a vanilla bug).
- You must now have the piety on hand to wage an Unsanctioned Holy War or Duchy Conquest (100/250 and 200/500 respectively).
- Moved African Pagans into their own religion group.
- Changed Abyssinia's territories to more closely match the actual Zagwe territories in 1066.
- Added the Kingdom of Semien (Beta Israel), a Jewish Kingdom controlling the Gondar region in 1066.
- It is now possible to revoke titles at autonomous vassals. I tried to find a way to make it possible only for vassals revoking their own vassals, but this is not doable and being unable to revoke makes autonomous vassals extremely undesirable even if you are a vassal which is just plain odd.
- Creating a Kingdom or Empire now costs a little bit of piety (to make the creation requirements less confusing).
- Orthodox AI is now much more reluctant to wage holy wars, to reduce ahistorical Russian blobbing into Finland and Byzantine blobbing into Romania.
- Pressing De Jure claims on a Holy Order of your religion now costs 500 piety.
- The AI will now avoid pressing De Jure claims on Holy Orders of their own religion.
- Integrated the ARKO pack and Patrum Scuta mods, both of which greatly improve both the regular and dynastic CoAs.
- Characters who are imprisoned by their liege will now have their honorary title revoked.
- Landless characters can now hold estates that give them small amounts of revenue and prestige, represented through character modifiers. Estates range from minor (1) to large (5) with each level giving more income and prestige. You can grant estates to characters at the cost of 50 gold per 'level'. Additionally, courtiers with money and no prospect to inherit titles will spend their own money to purchase estates. On a character's death, their estates are divided among their sons. Characters who gain a landed title will sell off their estates, and banished characters lose all their estates. Characters who are granted estates will like you more, and landless relatives are less likely to ask for or plot to get a landed title if they have been given estates. Characters with estates are given the special title 'Lord'.
- Added an objective for landless characters to get estates or increase the size existing estates.
- Reduced the base chance of the AI joining revolts since they are now more dangerous due to AI use of mercenaries.
- The AI should no longer be able to spawn mercenaries outside of its own realm.
- Tweaked genetics code to reduce the frequency of Genius, Quick, Slow and Imbecile.
- Rulers are no longer able to seduce themselves with the lover event chain.

1.27.1:
- Fixed a major bug that was preventing the AI from using Holy War and Duchy Conquest correctly.
- Tweaked independence wars to make De Jure status more important in determining whether vassals will seek independence.
- Tweaked civil wars so that when a liege's titles are divided among his vasals, another civil war should not immediately occur as he tries to take them back.

1.27:
- The AI now uses its own system for hiring mercenaries, and will make liberal use of them at the start of wars it cannot be sure to win, instead of hiring them after its armies have already been destroyed. The AI pays reduced maintenance for these mercenaries (because it does not use the regular mercenary system) but double the hiring cost to balance it out.
- Landless relatives are now more likely to plot against you if you are Muslim.
- Reworked decadence. It is now almost purely event-driven, with landed/unlanded relatives having no effect. Additionally, dynasty members who are vassals of other members of their dynasty will have no effect on decadence at all - good or bad. Bad traits and long periods of peace will increase decadence, while religious observance, good traits and participating in combat will decrease it. The overall effects of decadence on tax and morale were also reduced, to make it less of a factor.
- A titular Emperor whose realm drops below 75 holdings in size will now lose all their titular empire titles. Certain titles such as the Papacy, Mongol titles and the Latin Empire are exempt from this, as are Emperors who are in the midst of civil war (as this can temporarily reduce realm size).
- Difficulty setting now heavily affects the player's chance of discovering plots and the chance of vassals joining a revolt against them, for players who want more or less challenge from their vassals.
- Changed the requirements for creating an empire. Instead of requiring a set number of provinces, empires now require a certain Realm Size (number of holdings in realm, shown next to your demesne limit and score). Most empires require a Realm Size of 100 to create.
- Independence wars now work much like other revolts, with a ruler fighting an independence war calling in all other vassals to their war and all revolters becoming independent if the war succeeds. Non-De Jure vassals or vassals not of their liege's culture/religion are more likely to join an independence revolt, and De Jure vassals will tend to stay with a liege they do not greatly despise. The special 'escalating' nature of independence wars was removed, as this mechanic makes it obsolete.
- If a ruler is deposed and their realm is already at autonomous vassals (or they are a Duke or lower), their primary-level titles will now be divided among their vassals according to De Jure pretensions, with the most participating revolter getting first pick. Muslims and Pagans who are deposed will ALWAYS have their titles divided this way.
- Removed the special Muslim/Pagan realm destruction mechanic when deposed at autonomous vassals (they will have their titles divided up instead, as outlined above).
- The AI is now less likely to join a player revolt to depose their liege (to make it harder for players to revolt purely to divide up their liege's titles).
- Children with a very high stat in their chosen education (12+) are now more likely to pick up a good trait.
- Added some tweaks that should hopefully make the AI a bit better at picking tutors for their kids.
- The level of a guardian's education trait no longer matters in itself on how well their ward takes to the education, although it is still advantageous to have for instance a Midas Touched tutor because their high stewardship skill will rub off on the ward.
- Added a fix that should prevent Republics from ending up with wrong-religion group rulers because of wonky Open Elective mechanics.
- Added Principality of Wales as a titular Duchy for any character that controls Gwynedd and at least two Duchies (or a Kingdom or Empire).
- Religious authority changes from head of religion are now less deterministic - authority can weaken even under a strong head or strengthen under a weak one, although the diplomacy, piety and learning of the head of religion plays a large role. Overall authority should trend more towards 50 rather than the extreme ends of the spectrum.
- Tweaked Finni-Ugric ruler cultures to better match the culture of their provinces.
- AI rulers should now be more willing to join military plots of other AI rulers.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in the HRE.
- Added the province of Lolland in Sjaelland to give Denmark a boost and make it so you can't usurp Denmark with just Skåne.
- Reduced frequency of epidemics, to balance for their increased lethality.
- Epidemics will now reduce the size of levies you can raise in a province afflicted by one.
- Further reduced the chance of assassination plots being leaked by backers.

1.26.5:
- It is now possible for the Pope to call a Crusade against Orthodox Constantinople under rare and very specific circumstances. For this to happen, the Pope must have a suitable personality (greedy, cynical or nuts) and there must be a history of failed Crusades against heathens in the past (yes, I realize this is not how the Fourth Crusade happened but the Fourth Crusade is impossible to properly simulate).
- Jihads now once again work like Crusades, but with two differences: The AI is sharply limited in where it will call a Jihad (preferring using them against neighbours or as a countermeasure against Crusader states) and the top contributor will always hold on to the lands taken in a Jihad, rather than creating a new independent state.
- You can no longer vassalize holy orders, to prevent various bugs and exploits related to it.
- High Crown Authority is now required to Pogrom Jews settled in your vassals' cities.
- Reduced income from Pogroms.
- All decisions on the intrigue screen should now have proper icons.
- Decadence will no longer reduce vassal loyalty, and high decadence is no longer a death sentence for a Muslim state (although it is still very undesirable).
- If you fail a plot to fabricate a claim, you now have to wait 5 years before you can attempt it again.
- One less level of dishonorable will now be inherited by your heir (so if you had 2 levels of dishonorable, your heir will get level 1 Dynastic Stain).
- Dishonorable/Dynastic Stain will now go away slowly over time, at the rate of one level per twenty years.
- A failed Crusade will now result in all attacking participants losing piety and prestige.
- Added some sanity checks that should make it impossible for a plot victim to get dishonorable as a result of an attempt on their life.
- The Immortal trait can now be inherited by children.
- Increased the opinion malus for demanding a character convert religion.
- Split Rus into the Kingdoms of Kiev, Muscowy and Novgorod.
- Russian Kings are now called Grand Princes.
- Russian Dukes are now called Princes.
- The ruler of Kiev now starts with the Kingdom of Kiev.
- Added Welsh and Cornish empires.
- Added Mizrehim culture for Persian and Middle Eastern jews.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing cultural conversion from working correctly.

1.26.4:
- Fixed another duplicate character ID issue.
- The Immortal trait should now work properly if given to a character with the ruler designer.
- The Israel title should now properly control the Jewish faith.

1.26.3:
- Fixed a duplicate character ID issue that was causing CTDs.

1.26.2:
- Integrated all character history changes from 1.06.
- Jewish characters who hold Jerusalem can now form the Kingdom of Israel, a title that makes them head of the Jewish religion.
- AI Muslim rulers are now very reluctant to join other Muslim rulers' Jihads.
- Any Muslim King or Emperor can now call a Jihad at the cost of 500 piety.
- Added Jewish Communities to the game. They are a special tax income building for cities that represents a Jewish community within a city, and which cannot be built through ordinary means. Instead, holdings that historically had Jewish communties will start the game with them, and these communities can grow and migrate throughout the game. Players with Jewish communities in their realm will get access to Jewish courtiers, and have the option to do a Pogrom - expel the Jews in their lands and seize their wealth. Jews who have been expelled will go from court to court until they find a new liege willing to shelter them in his or her cities.
- Fixed a bug that resulted in double prestige loss when switching out of Elective succession.
- Reduced base decadence growth for unlanded relatives.
- Vassals with 100 opinion of you should now never join a revolt against you.
- Removed decadence invasions. Instead, rulers with 75+ decadance will get very severe penalties to relations with their vassals.
- Muslims who execute characters of their dynasty will now get some decadence, to prevent decadence management from simply being a game of execute everyone.
- It is once again possible for Pagans and Muslims to fabricate claims (as this is necessary for expansion inside the same realm).
- If an independent Pagan or Muslim ruler is deposed or defeated in an independence war and are either a Duke or have the lowest level of Crown Authority on all their Kingdom and Empire-level titles, their realm will now be destroyed and all their non-Baron vassals become independent. Combined with the Duchy Conquest CB, this should make for Muslim and Pagan realms that expand rapidly, but are highly prone to collapse.
- Replaced Pagan/Muslim County Conquest with a Duchy Conquest CB that works like Holy War against same-religion countries but at twice the piety cost. Like Holy War, this CB cannot be used on rulers in the same realm.
- It is now easier to get sanction for Holy Wars, especially at high relations.
- The option to grant Crusade lands to a distant relative will now grant it to a suitable male relative in your realm. If no such relative exists, the option changes to granting the land to a randomly generated courtier not of your dynasty.
- Changed the requirements for recreating the Caliphates to be the same as in vanilla.
- Fixed a bug that caused assaults to be possible against cities and temples with no wall uprades even when the No Assaults module was being used.
- Removed the Mongol reinforcement events, which should reduce their ability to continously blob for decades.
- Fleshed out history files in West Africa, so that the various states there should be properly playable at any date.
- Tweaked West African borders and added some more provinces.
- Many of the culture-based Empires (for example the Frankish Empire) can now be created without holding any specific capital, as long as you are the right culture and
- Empires now require a certain amount of counties in your realm to form, in addition to holding the requisite number of Kingdom titles. Most Empires require 4 Kingdom titles and 30+ realm provinces, though the requirements for West African and East African empires are lower to make them able to form more historically.
- Crusades now only affect the attacking side's authority.
- Holy Wars now give a small amount of moral authority to the attacking side if won, and a small loss if lost. The defending side's authority is not affected either way.
- Added a large number of culture-specific formable empires. Nearly all cultures should now have their own unique empire to form.
- Martially educated characters no longer get commander traits on completing their education. Instead, they can learn up to their allowed amount of commander traits during battle.

1.26.1:
- If a vassal revolt is defeated, all participating vassals will now be imprisoned instead of just the leader.
- Disabled the use of the Not De Jure Liege trait, as the 25% revolt risk difference already coded in should be sufficient reason to want to hold de jure titles.
- Being deposed in an excommunication war will now result in a loss of Crown Authority.
- If a child ruler is deposed by his vassals, the vassal that led the revolt will now take the throne.
- Muslims will now get faster culture spread to compensate for the fact that it takes them longer to convert province religion (and thus make the province eligible for conversion).
- Changing gender succession laws now costs prestige.
- You can now change out of Elective at any time, but it will trigger a one-time vote among the Electors to determine if the new succession law is approved. High crown authority and good relations with your vassals will make it easier for the vote to pass. If the vote fails, you will not be able to try again on the same ruler.
- Bohemia now starts the game as a Kingdom, to get around it being uncreateable with the new 3 duchy rule.
- Increased the number of duchies required to form a Kingdom to 3.
- Kings may now hold up to 3 duchies personally, although Elective Kings will still get a penalty for holding more than one elector title.
- Fixed various minor bugs and typos detected by the validator.
- Tweaked genetics code to make inheritance of a genetic trait more likely if both parents have it.
- Reduced the chance of a murder plot being revealed by a backer.
- If a murder attempt on your plot target fails and is discovered, the plot will now be aborted.
- Added Khazar and (Volga) Bulgar cultures.
- Immortal characters should no longer catch infectous diseases.
- Greatly increased warscore from battles to help the AI along since it now seems far too reluctant to siege. This may unbalance smaller wars (100%+ warscore battles) due to the poor way battle warscore scales, but hopefully it should be nothing game-breaking.
- Fixed a rare bug that could make a tournament last forever in small realms.
- The county conquest CB for non-Christians now costs 250 prestige instead of 100 piety.
- Only Christians can now fabricate claims (Pagans/Muslims are meant to use county conquest instead).

1.26:
- Disabled Jihads until I can write a new system for them, as the AI will not obey weighting and the repeated conquests of Thessalonica and Croatia while Anatolia remains Byzantine are simply absurd.
- Removed the insta-game over on 100 tyranny. Instead, tyranny now increases revolt risk and higher levels of tyranny will also result in severe penalties to tax and morale.
- Offering Vassalization and Swearing Fealty now costs prestige. This is to try and prevent Empire-level realms from immediately reforming after independence wars are fought.
- The Cumans no longer start the game as an empire.
- The Kingdom of Germany is no longer held by the HRE at game start.
- Fixed a bug that could cause multiple plot murder events to fire simultaneously.
- Fixed a major bug that was breaking many random events.
- Added an optional module that disables assaults in sieges.
- Trait opinion effects are now less generic and much more dependent on opposing traits, meaning for example that fewer traits affect the opinion of all your vassals, but being Cynical will have a much greater opinion effect on your Zealous vassals. This should make it a bit harder to create an 'optimal' set of traits that makes all your vassals love you.
- The Kind trait no longer gives a combat bonus.
- The Paranoid trait now gives a combat bonus.
- The Trusting trait now gives a combat malus.

1.25.2:
- Feudal titles that have non-feudal successions (such as Investiture) should now be automatically fixed on the next maintenance pulse.
- Fixed another missing graphics bug that was causing CTDs.
- Restricted the effects of melting pots to rulers that hold land in the appropriate Kingdom (such as England for English) and their courts.
- The Il-Khanate and Golden Horde can no longer convert to another religion while at war.

1.25.1:
- New versioning system. All versions with the same middle number (1.25.XX etc) are now tested as save game compatible.
- Re-enabled assaults with some tweaks that should hopefully stop the AI from suiciding with them.
- Fixed a bug with demesne laws that caused them to reset on loading a save (hopefully for real this time...)
- Fixed some missing graphics.
- English Longbowmen line of buildings are now available to Welsh and Cornish provinces/characters.

1.25:
- Fixed a bug with demesne laws that caused them to reset on loading a save.
- Byzantium's succession laws should now work correctly.
- Disabled assaults again (this time in a way that does not break sieges) until Paradox writes better assault AI.

1.24:
- Now compatible with version 1.06b.
- The AI will now Observe the Ramadan when their decadence is high.
- All events are now properly integrated with 1.06 event changes.
- You can now province conquest yourself into negative piety the same way you can with Holy Wars.
- Reduced the cost of creating titular titles.
- Fixed yet another bug that was making the revoke vassal title plot not show up.
- The fabricate claim plots should now work correctly.
- The gain liege title plot now uses mostly vanilla requirements.
- Adjusted education logic to take into account the lower base stats introduced in 1.06, this should make the higher level education traits less rare.
- Fixed a bug that was causing children to take the culture/religion of their educator even if their province didn't share it.

1.23:
- Fixed a CTD related to education events.
- Anglo-Norse now have access to the Saxon/English cultural buildings.
- Got rid of the Outremer melting pot as it caused some unexpected issues when European powers also had middle eastern holdings.
- It is now easier to convert Pagan provinces if you are not Pagan.
- It is now harder to convert non-Pagan provinces if you are Pagan.
- Fixed some bugs with tyranny being incorrectly given from justified imprisonments.
- Holy Wars no longer increase or decrease religious authority.
- Increased the effects of province conversions on religious authority.
- Fixed a bug where Holy Wars between different Muslim faiths would end inconclusively.
- Fixed a bug with succession on Theocracy titles, that among other things would make the Byzantine Emperor inherit the Patriarchy.
- Further tweaked moral authority to make low authority faiths more likely to 'bounce back' if a they have a high diplomacy, learning or piety head of religion.
- Immortal characters should no longer become infirm or incapable.
- It should now be easier to tell the two Caliph titles apart.

1.22:
- Fixed Muslim Theocracy succession laws to correspond to 1.06 changes.
- Thessaloncia is now De Jure Byzantium (for real this time).
- Added in some missing opinion modifiers.
- Introduced vanilla tactics system for 1.06 after some balance testing.
- The scarred trait will now get properly added to (some) characters who had been wounded.
- Fixed a duplication issue with CBs.

1.21:
- Now compatible with 1.06, with various tweaks to merge CK2+ mechanics with 1.06 mechanics. Piety cost for Muslim/Pagan conquest CB was increased to 100.
- Cut a number of features that were made superfluous by the 1.06 patch, such as the Appointed/Hereditary titles law, Concubines and the Dynamic title system.
- The effects of old age (lower health, fertility and martial, higher learning) has been made transparent to the player in the form of an 'Old' trait given at age 50, whose effects progressively increase as a character grows older.
- AI rulers are now much less likely to go native if their culture has little in common with the culture of their capital (for instance, Greeks are unlikely to go Turkish and vice versa).
- Fixed a bug where plots against your liege were unavailable because you were the primary heir to an unrelated title.
- The decisions for Feast, Summer Fair and Grand Hunt can now be executed at any time of the year, though the event itself will not occur until the proper month (so if you use the Grand Hunt decision in March, it will occur in September of the same year, but if you use it between September and October it will occur instantly). Note that you can still only do each of these once per year.
- Tweaked buildings to add some additional requirements for the higher level buildings and reduce the bloated late-game levies caused by stacking levy size modifiers.
- You can no longer be excommunicated for holding Rome if you have an Anti-Pope in your realm.
- Children who are not assigned a guardian should now get one assigned to them automatically within a few months. This will happen less quickly for close relatives of the ruler.
- Reduced the average number of personality traits characters should end up with, as trait bloating tends to get a bit ridiculous at times.
- Added the Outremer Empire as a formable title.
- Slowed down the spread of heresy.
- Large realms should now be a bit more prone to collapsing into independent states.
- Reaching 100 (max) tyranny will now result in being deposed in favor of a different dynasty (meaning Game Over for the player).
- Armies at sea are now at risk of being hit by a storm that will kill a large portion of the embarked forces. It is therefore a good idea to minimize the amount of time your troops spend at sea (and no longer wise to use embarked troops as a mobile reserve to trick the AI with).
- Added a decision to repay a loan, if you have the money and want to do it before the due date.
- The AI will no longer hand out certain large Kingdoms to vassals (for example they will hold on to Rus, France and Germany).
- The AI will no longer hand Kingdoms to vassals not of their culture group.
- Added an Anglo-Norse melting pot for Scandinavians that conquer Anglo-Saxon provinces.
- Added an Outremer melting pot for Iberians/Latins that conquer land in Egypt or Jerusalem/Syria.

1.20:
- Fixed a bug where Thessalonica was not de jure Byzantium on game start.
- Added more titular empires and made certain titular empires available to all cultures. The goal is to have at least one culture-specific empire for each culture, plus one 'available to all' option for each major region. A complete list of currently formable Empires and their requirements will be made available in the next few days.
- Added a workaround to correct an issue where vassals granted titles via event would become a vassal of your liege instead of yourself.
- Increased frequency of random genetic traits in newborns.
- You will no longer be able to escape the consequenses of defaulting on a loan by dying.
- Consequenses of defaulting on a loan now last longer.
- If you default on a loan you will now be unable to take another in your lifetime.
- You can now plot to kill any character in the game.
- If your murder plot is revealed before it is put in action, you may now become dishonorable as a consequense.
- You no longer get a decision to kill characters with plots. Instead, you have to wait for an event to fire that gives you the option on whether to strike with your current plot power, wait for a better opportunity, or call it off altogether. Higher plot power and more backers will make the event fire sooner. Note that this makes it possibly to execute kill plots with very low plot power (as long as you have at least one backer), although you will have very poor odds of success.
- Fixed a bug where maintenance would incorrectly remove the Appointed/Hereditary titles law from Byzantium.
- Emperors will now hand out King-level titles to loyal vassals, though they will always retain at least one King title for themselves.

1.19:
- Fixed some bugs in the dynamic title system related to the AI creating Kingdoms.
- Fixed a bug where non-Muslim rulers could end up with Open succession as a result of conquering land. The succession will now auto-correct on the next maintenance pulse.
- Reverted to old civil war system as the new one seems to not be working properly.

1.18:
- Fixed a game-breaking bug where the Pope would not, in fact, be wearing a Pope hat.
- Provinces are now converted faster if there is an adjoining province of the same culture or culture group of the religion you are trying to convert to.
- 40% moral authority is now required for calling a Crusade or Jihad, to prevent a death spiral of failed Crusades killing off moral authority.
- Tweaked moral authority to increase faster as a result of a competent head of religion.
- West Africa is no longer accessible by ship, to make it more appropriately isolated from the rest of the world.
- State martial score now increases minimum levy size.
- State intrigue now reduces revolt risk in provinces.
- After some consideration, I have restored the old stewardship demense size variable (1 per 10). Instead of nerfing stewardship, I will be aiming to increase the effects of the other stats to make them just as useful.

1.17:
- Simplified the Tyranny system. Instead of a variable amount of Tyranny based on rank and cause, any action that gave the tyrant opinion modifier in vanilla will now give an appropriate amount of tyranny that is now shown in the tooltip when carrying out the action. This was the only way to correct a number of bugs with actions giving tyranny when they shouldn't be. As a result the system is now less flexible but much easier to understand. Tyranny costs are now as follows: 10/20 for unlawfully imprisoning a courtier/vassal, 5/10 for executing a courtier/vassal, 0/20 for banishing a courtier/vassal.
- Fixed more bugs with succession laws.
- Culture-specific buildings will no longer be destroyed unless the culture of the province changes, although you will still be unable to build them unless you are of the appropriate culture.

1.16:
- Added more culture-specific buildings.
- Slightly increased effects of stewardship on demesne size.
- Fixed a bug with tourneys that caused them to not end correctly.
- Fixed some bugs with localisation and graphics on the 'Befriend Top Liege' ambition.
- Reduced the effects of difficulty on councillor actions (they were a bit extreme).
- Fixed some problems with the loading order of the mod.
- Fixed a bug where a woman could become simultaneously pregnant with her spouse and her lover.

1.15:
- Now compatible with version 1.05g.
- Upgraded to the latest version of Better Looking Characters, which features a number of performance improvements that should make it less memory intensive.
- Integrated Mercator Mod, which improves greatly on the game's terrain with proper mountain placement, river locations, etc.
- Titular titles will now never be elective when created.
- If your demesne laws are higher than what crown authority allows (for example because crown authority went down) an event will now fire that adjusts them to their highest allowed level.
- Added events for pious Muslim or Christian rulers to sponsor missions to a neighbouring Pagan ruler, which have a chance of converting that ruler to the sponsor's faith.
- Reworked the effects of difficulty. Instead of providing flat bonuses to the player or the AI, difficulty now instead influences things such as councillor actions, loans and vassal loyalty. A player on low difficulty will (to name a few effects) find it easier to fabricate claims and have vassals stay loyal during civil wars, while getting the opposite effect on high difficulty. A high difficulty AI will get more claims, better terms on loans and other such things to make up for its various shortcomings versus a player. On Normal, AIs play almost entirely by the same rules as a player. Only a single flat bonus was left in place: Siege speed. High difficulty AIs will be more difficult to siege to account for their tendency to only siege a single province at once.
- Victory in a succession war will now result in taking all the enemy's titles you have claims on in addition to taking the title whose succession you were disputing.
- Reworked civil wars. Vassals who choose to side with their liege will now actively join the war and raise their troops to fight the traitors. To compensate for this, the base chance of vassals joining a civil war was increased.
- AI vassals will now be reluctant to rebel against an AI ruler that has recently been in a civil war.
- It is once again possible for your character's culture to spread to your capital, even if there is no adjacent province of the same culture. The chance is greatly reduced unless your character is independent.
- Neighbours will no longer get a religious call to arms when war is declared between characters of the same religion group (as long as one is not a heresy of the other).
- Further refined education formula. The child's attributes are now more important than the tutor's trait in how well they take to their education, though educator trait still makes a significant difference. Overall frequency of level 3 and 4 education traits were lowered.
- Nearly all decisions now have graphical icons to make them more immediately visually identifiable.
- Martial skill is now much more important in determining who wins a grand tournament.
- Upped Kingdom creation cost to 500 gold and Empire creation cost to 1000 gold.
- Further decreased effects of personal stewardship on demesne limit.
- Removed piety cost for Kingdom creation. While it makes sense for Catholics, it doesn't for pretty much every other faith and it always felt strange how impious, ambitious characters were locked out of making themselves Kings.
- AI rulers will now only attempt to Restore the Papacy once after it is lost. If they make the attempt and fail, the same character will not try again.
- Attempts to Restore the Papacy to Rome can now only be made for 100 years after it is lost.
- De Jure claim wars now always result in seizing the province, to prevent the situations where you would force-vassalize a character and he would revolt immediately as the war ends.
- State martial skill now influences the amount of troops you can raise from your vassals.
- The AI will now usurp Kingdoms that it controls more than 50% of the land in, even if it already has a Kingdom or Empire level title.
- The AI will no longer limit itself to a single Kingdom, creating any Kingdom titles it is eligible for with the exception of titles inside a de jure empire that it holds.
- Added titular Kingdoms of Bavaria, Prussia and Khazaria.
- If a titular kingdom turns de jure, the special creation/usurp penalties from it are now removed (so if the Kingdom of Venice has de jure land, it is no longer only holdable by republics, for example).
- Players without an ambition will now suffer a penalty to their prestige (to prevent an exploit where the player would only pick ambitions as they are about to complete).
- Removed the 'No New Empires' module (as it no longer serves a purpose).
- Implemented a new system of dynamic empires. All de jure Empires except the HRE and Byzantium are now gone, and are instead replaced by a large number of titular empires that can be formed by any ruler with the right culture and 4 kingdom titles. The following empires are currently createable via this system: Latin Empire, Frankish Empire, Occitan Empire, Italian Empire, Roman Empire, Polish Empire, Russian Empire, Persian Empire, Danubian Empire, Spanish Empire, Maghreb Empire, Arabian Empire, Egyptian Empire, Celtic Empire, Nordic Empire, Ethiopian Empire, Britannian Empire, Mali Empire, Lithuanian Empire, Finnish Empire, Magyar Empire, Seljuk Turks, Ottoman Empire and Al-Andalus.
- Removed all religion limits on creating de jure kingdom titles. Instead, some titles will have an 'alternate' version for muslims, and on creating that title the non-muslim title will be destroyed and the muslim title will take its place. If the muslim title is then destroyed and re-created by christians or pagans, it reverts to the non-muslim version. (For example: If a muslim ruler creates Portugal, he will get the Sultanate of Al-Garb instead, with Portugal's de jure lands. If his realm is wiped out and Al-Garb is created by a Christian, that Christian will get the Kingdom of Portugal).
- Fixed some bugs related to starting succession laws. As a result, you will be unable to change succession laws in the first week or so after starting a new game.
- Heresies no longer affect or are affected by moral authority changes from Holy Wars and province conversion.
- Courtiers can now take lovers among other courtiers, and young men or women with much older spouses will be particularily suspectible to romance.
- Changing succession laws now requires and costs 125/250/500/750/1000 prestige for Barons/Counts/Dukes/Kings/Emperors respectively. Changing gender succession laws does not cost prestige.
- Removed crown law requirements for switching succession laws. Medium Crown Authority is still required for switching an Elective Kingdom or Empire away from being Elective.
- You can no longer complete the 'Amass Wealth' objective by taking a loan.
- Increased base amount of troops from holdings.
- Increased build cost of holdings.
- Fixed a bug that caused countries to incorrectly become independent when a third-party claim was pressed.
- Revamped tyranny mechanics. When you perform tyrannical actions (such as imprisoning, banishing or executing characters) without a rightful cause, you will now get tyranny 'points' that translate into a Tyrant trait with a potency from 1 to 100. For each point of tyranny, you suffer penalties to prestige and vassal opinion. Imprisoning and executing characters when you have rightful cause to do so (for example if they rebelled against you) will not result in any tyranny, and the tyranny penalties for banishment are lowered if you have rightful cause. Note that a character revolting/acting dishonorably towards you will only give you cause for ONE punishment, so you can either revoke, banish OR execute them... additional punishments will result in normal amounts of tyranny. Tyranny goes away over time, and will not be inherited by your successor when you die.
- You will now get kinslayer only for executing or assassinating close relatives (rather than any dynasty member).
- Fixed some issues with weird/conflicting assassination plot requirements.
- AI characters that have been caught assassinating before are now less likely to plan new assassinations.
- A character that wins an invasion will now get claims on all Counties and Duchies in the target Kingdom.
- You can no longer pick the ambition to befriend a character you are at war with (and the ambition will abort if you go to war with them).
- Added an ambition to befriend your top liege (if not the same as your direct liege).

1.14:
- Better Looking Characters is now an optional module that requires the Mongol Faces DLC. If you are having issues with graphics, performance or load times, try playing without BLC as it increases CK2's memory usage considerably.

1.13:
- Upgraded to version 7 of Better Looking Characters.
- Fixed a bug that was causing feasts, hunting and summer fairs to become permanently unavailable for a character.
- Jews can now create the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
- Harder difficulty levels will no longer increase AI income, but will lower player income instead (for players who think money is too plentiful).
- Tweaked a vanilla event that was causing Catholic moral authority to increase far too quickly.
- How you vote on your liege's law proposals will now influence his or her opinion of you.
- Fixed a rare bug that would result in characters being given two education traits.
- Further decreased chances of children picking up the higher level education traits.
- When a character usurps  their liege's primary title, they will now also take the liege's capital province (so that if a pretender seizes the Byzantine Empire they should also get Constantinople, for example).
- Corrected some newly introduced performance issues.
- Courtiers with honorary titles and money will now marry on their own unless that honorary title is Court Jester or Concubine.
- Extending a loan will now only extend it for two years.
- Exiling characters now costs prestige, to prevent an exploit where a low ranked player could repeatedly imprison and banish his baron vassals for large sums of money.
- Players can now complete many ambitions multiple times, although the rewards for completing them are greatly lessened after the first time.
- Fixed a bug where lack of crown laws would incorrectly reset your demesne laws to the lowest level.
- Fixed some bugs with lover events where women could get impregnated by their female lovers.
- Female councillors will no longer marry other women.

1.12:
- Now compatible with official patch 1.05f.
- Upgraded to latest version of Culturally Different Cities.
- The Komnenos dynasty now starts with claims to Byzantium in 1066.
- Kingdoms and Empires must now have at least Medium crown authority to fight a de jure war over a province whose Duchy they do not control.
- Removed the attribute nerfs on birth since new education system makes them redundant (and I can always just tweak good education trait chances down if stat inflation becomes a problem again).
- Added a new education system. Children will now get an education trait sometime between the age of 15 and 16 instead of getting it on their 16th birthday. The trait they get will always be the same archetype as their tutor (ie a tutor with an intrigue trait will generate an intrigue trait for their student) but which trait the child gets is now influenced by the child's own attributes, so a high martial child is likely to do well in a martial education for example. Randomization was also increased so the child doesn't just get the exact same trait as their tutor almost every time. Overall, the higher end education traits should now be significantly rarer.
- Added a notification event that fires when one of your close relatives turns 16, letting you know that they are an adult and which education trait they got (to compensate for the lack of an education notification).
- Reduced the power/cost of universities and increased the power/cost of monastic schools, to make Temples the foremost holding for research speed.
- Decreased the chance of healthy women dying in childbirth.
- Upgraded to latest version of family relations mod.
- Sped up the spread of English and Sicilian cultures.
- The learning and piety of a head of religion will now influence the moral authority of that religion through events.
- Randomly generated characters (both at game start and after) should now properly get assigned genetic traits.
- Removed the Arrange Courtier Marriages decision. Instead, courtiers with money and a position on your council will marry on their own.
- Reduced the piety cost of early Crusades, to make Crusade-less games less likely.
- When you win an independence war, the defeated ruler will now get claims on your titles.
- Changed the way loans work. Instead of an event that fires when you go into the red, a loan can now be taken at any time through a decision. The loan amount scales to your income, and is always a five-year loan at 25% interest. If you do not have the money to pay it back on the due date, you can extend it for another five years by paying the interest. If your character dies with an unpaid loan, the debt will be transfered to your heir.
- The AI will now make use of loans during wartime in order to buy mercenaries and fund its armies.
- AI will now only change succession laws under fairly specific circumstances (so half the world won't switch to Primogeniture on day one of the game).
- Reduced the penalty for characters dying in prison.
- Reduced the chance of prisoners in the dungeon falling ill.
- Imprisoned characters can no longer join a revolt.
- Increased the chance of characters with titles escaping from prison. The higher ranked the character, the higher the chance of them making the attempt.
- Reduced starting troop multiplier for Alp Arslan (due to the changes below).
- Added more buildings to the Seljuk Turks and increased the strength of the Ghilmans.
- Removed some holdings in Byzantium and reduced the strength of the Varangian Guard.
- Further improved performance by removing some unnecessary AI checks and moving others to events.
- Added two new ambitions: Befriend Liege and Befriend Head of Religion.
- Building destruction on siege events should now work correctly.
- Added two events associated with the 'Research Economy Tech' action. The positive event improves province prosperity, while the negative event results in temporary revolt risk.
- Center leader martial skill is now a very important factor for reducing attrition to your troops.
- Reduced the effects of Siege Equipment, to balance out for the removal of Military Fortifications.
- Replaced the Military Fortifications tech with Logistics, which increases supply limits to better correspond to later game army sizes.
- Attrition is once again a factor in war, although at greatly reduced maximum rates and heavily tweaked holding supply effects.
- Reduced garrison sizes to make stalled wars less likely.
- Increased effectiveness of defending garrison during assaults (to make up for lower numbers).
- Tweaked province prosperity events so that the extreme ends of the spectrum (Rich/Struggling) are less common.
- When pushing third-party claims, the tooltip will no longer say that the claimaint will become your landed vassal if that is not possible because the pushed title is equal or higher rank than your own.
- When pushing third-party claims, the claimaint will now remain your vassal if the title you are pushing is in the same realm as your own (ie held by your liege or one of his/her vassals).
- Pushing a third-party claim will no longer turn a character independent if the title you pushed for him or her was not already independent.
- You can now plot to kill characters whose title you or your child is a pretender to.
- Removed the demesne size requirements for raising crown authority, as they all too often locked the AI at autonomous vassals.
- Most titles formable by Christians are now also formable by Pagans.
- Kingdom of Wends can now be formed by Wends of any religion.

1.11:
- Fixed a CTD on startup caused by the lack of congenital/birth traits.

1.10:
- Fixed a bug that was causing characters to get dynastic stain when they should not be.
- Fixed a bug that was causing regency trait not to be applied properly.
- Fixed a bug that was causing congenital traits not to be distributed properly.
- Learning will now influence province prosperity, so a high state learning will make it more likely for your provinces to grow prosperous and less likely for them to become poor.
- The AI will now favor vassals that have the 'Gain Honorary Title' ambition when handing out honorary titles.
- Increased opinion bonus for dynasty back to +10.
- Reduced opinion bonus for sibling from 20 to 15.
- Reintroduced monthly authority loss for creating an Anti-Pope, but greatly reduced the initial authority loss (This should make Anti-Popes a 'hot potato').

1.09:
- Fixed a bug that was causing significant slowdown due to bloated AI courts. Game performance should now be much better.
- Moved most CK2+ events to the yearly or bi-yearly character event pulses to further improve performance.
- Increased AI tendency to plot.
- Reduced opinion bonus for same dynasty.
- Integrated avee's family relations mod that increases character's opinions of their close family.
- Realms without crown authority can now have up to the second level of taxation/levy laws.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the invasion CB.
- Further improved title distribution AI, to make the AI less willing to hand away its demesne when there are other alternatives.
- Added dynasty, culture and religion information to character tooltips.
- Reduced minimum gift size (but kept the increased gift scaled cost the same).
- Increased the plot power required to execute the better assassination decisions, and also slightly increased their chance of success.
- Removed Castellans. While I feel they are a good feature, I couldn't find a way to fix the various bugs and issues with the way honorary titles are coded, and I don't want to have a permanently half-broken feature in the mod.
- Greatly increased prestige gain from winning battles.
- Reworked the way joining wars works. The ask to join war diplomatic mechanic is now reserved solely for Crusades. Instead, when a ruler is declared on by a ruler of a different faith for any conquest-type CB (holy war, claim, de jure claim, etc), they get the option to ask all their neighbours of the same faith (neighbour being defined as sharing a border or sharing provinces in the same kingdom). Chance of joining depends on relations, traits, dynastic ties and other such factors. This should make the AI far more reasonable and realistic about which holy wars it joins (you no longer get all of North Africa defending Sicily, for instance), and simultaneously eliminates the exploit of using other CBs to get around holy war defensive chains.
- Reduced demesne size requirements for raising crown authority to a level the AI can better cope with.
- Buildings can now be randomly destroyed as a consequense of provinces being besieged.
- Added province prosperity mechanics. Provinces now have a prosperity level that goes (in descending order): Rich - Prosperous - Normal - Poor - Struggling. Prosperity level affects the tax and levies you can get from the province, and will go up and down from various events. Peace and quiet tends to increase province prosperity, while war and rebellions reduces it.
- Restored the ability for women to pass on pressable claims to their kids. This makes it possible once again to marry into claims.
- Province conversions will now very slightly increase the moral authority of the converting religion, and decrease the authority of the converted.
- Religions no longer gain any moral authority from the diplomacy of their head of religion.
- Anti-Popes no longer cause continous moral authority loss, but the moral authority loss from creating one was greatly increased.
- Reduced the moral authority hit to the loser in a Crusade.
- Reduced frequency of heresies.
- Reduced maintenance cost of levies.
- Reduced the bonus troops granted to rulers defending against a Crusade/Jihad.
- The Almoravids once again start as a Sultanate instead of an Emirate, as this leads to more historical results.
- Fixed a bug where the Pope getting the land in a Crusade would result in a smattering of independent counts.
- The inherited/appointed titles law is now available to Byzantium (to represent the Theme system).
- Added the titular kingdoms of Sardinia, Dublin, Mann and the Isles, Mercia and Cornwall.
- Newborn characters now start with negative stats, in an effort to reduce the extreme stat inflation from education over time. An adjustment event fires later in childhood to ensure that base stats do not remain in the negative.
- Removed the vassal opinion bonus from Elective. While it makes sense, it feel it makes an already extremely good succession law even better.
- Primogeniture no longer lowers the opínion of your dynasty.
- Elective now lowers the opinion of your dynasty (due to opening up the succession outside of the bloodline).
- Tweaked mercenaries to have more 500 and 1000-size companies.
- Added mercenaries to West Africa.
- Tweaked provinces in West Africa and added an additional province to the Duchy of Laayoune.
- Fixed a bug where changing the crown authority of an Empire would cause multiple stacking opinion penalties.

1.08:
- Players can now do De Jure wars against other religion groups, until I rework the way joining Holy Wars works.
- Tumbling your courtiers is no longer a male-only or straight-only activity.
- Crusader states should now always become Feudal, even if the most participating attacker in the Crusade is not.
- Halved the effects of legalism on demesne size.
- Vassals will no longer join a claim on liege war that is not targeting one of the liege's primary-level titles. This should prevent situations where you are fighting your liege for a claim on a vassal and that vassal joins the war on your side.
- Tweaked West Africa to be slightly more historical and considerably more balanced.
- Increased frequency of bad events (buildings destroyed, characters killed, armies rising up) from revolts.
- Restored economic buildings to former levels, with the exception of ports as they made coastal cities rather overpowered at their previous income levels.
- If you press a claim of lower rank than their primary title on behalf of a vassal, they will now stay in your realm (so you can press Count claims on behalf of Dukes, etc).
- Fixed some issues with weird straits caused by province realigning.
- You can no longer declare third-party de jure wars on characters of a different religion group.

1.07:
- Now compatible with version 1.05e.
- Ran the mod through the validator and fixed numerous minor errors.
- De Jure vassals are now more inclined to choose depose CBs over independence war CBs.
- Reduced the number of short reign years but increased the opinion penalties for Regency, to make succession issues rarer but more serious.
- Reduced the opinion boost for being entrusted with a ward.
- Increased the cost of gifts, to make the cost better scaled to how powerful they have become (I would reduce their opinion effects if I could).
- Reduced the dynastic opinion bonus to 15 on account of the tendency of dynasty members to stay loyal during revolts by non-dynasty members and the reduced opinion maluses from title claimaints.
- The cost of fabricating claims now scales with your primary title level. Fabricating a claim on a County/Duchy costs 100/200, 150/300 and 200/400 for Counts, Dukes and Kings/Emperors respectively.
- A character that wins their invasion war (for example, William the Conqueror if he wins the Norman Invasion) now gains a ten-year truce modifier that prevents all external wars, in the same way newly formed crusader states do.
- Holy Orders will now get the ten-year truce modifier when they are granted a piece of land via event.
- The negative effects of bankruptcy now scale, with increasing penalties for every 250 gold you owe up to a maximum of 1000.
- It is no longer possible to create the Mongol/Timurid titles.
- Fixed numerous bugs with depose type CBs where wars would not end properly or revolters would become independent as a result of an abdication. As a part of these fixes, it will now take 1 day between the end of a successful depose war and the actual abdication of the loser.
- Oman now starts independent. I realize this is ahistorical, but equally ahistorical is the fact that it becomes the final holdout of the Seljuk Turks in most games, and I feel having it independent improves gameplay in the area.
- Cumans are now an Empire and Cherson is now in the Kingdom of Crimea. This was done to try and prevent Cumans from always ending up as a de jure title.
- Increased prestige gain for marrying into prestigious dynasties.
- Icelandic is now a separate culture.
- You can no longer fight De Jure wars against characters of a different religion group, to prevent them being used to get around the Holy War defensive chains.
- Reduced Holy Order cost back to 50 piety.
- Muslims can now only appoint a single concubine, as court sizes quickly get ridiculous with three of them.
- Added barony names, starting baronies and a reasonable number of barony slots to West Africa, so the area is now actually worth playing in. Many of the barony names have no historical grounds (named after modern settlements) so any input on name replacements from people knowledgeable of medieval West Africa would be welcome.
- Split Mauretania into the Kingdoms of Mauretania and Morocco.
- Integrated the All the Way to Timbuktu mod that adds 30 new provinces in West Africa, along with three new Kingdoms and a new Empire.
- Integrated Syren's Nicknames Mod with over 90 new ruler nicknames.
- Integrated Better Looking Characters mod. The parts that require the Mongol Faces DLC were placed in the optional module 'Mongol Faces'.
- The Papal State is now an Empire, both to prevent the Pope from being vassalized and to prevent the Papal State from assimiliating Spoleto.
- Removed the building cost reduction on oversee construction, but made it so the 'Meets Master Builder' event lowers the cost of all construction in the province by 20% for 10 years.
- Reduced the tax bonus from having your Steward collect taxes.
- Reduced the power of economic buildings. On average, a tax income building will pay itself back in 100 years.
- Pressing claims on behalf of claimaints now works as in vanilla, where a character will only become your landed vassal if they are your de jure vassal or of your dynasty.
- There are now three Muslim Titlar Kingdoms in Iberia: Al-Mawsat (Capital: Granada), Al-Xarq (Capital: Porto) and Al-Garb (Capital: Zaragoza). A ruler that holds all three can form the Titular Empire of Al-Andalus.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Crusade/Jihad notifications from working properly.
- The AI must now spend some piety to call a Crusade or Jihad (preventing repeated failed Crusades by the same character).
- A ruler defending against a Crusade or Jihad can now call on a very large portion of their levies (players cannot do so if they are also fighting an offensive war).

1.06:
- Now compatible with 1.05d.
- Tweaked the Duchies in Syria and Mesopotamia.
- Mongol armies now vary from anywhere between 40k and 100k troops.
- Mongol titles are no longer 'landless', as this resulted in far too many little issues with succession and CBs. Instead, they will now seize a chunk of land around their starting province when they alive, and will be destroyed if their last county is taken. This should fix all the major bugs with Mongols not arriving, having weird successions, etc. As a side effect this also makes it possible to play as the Mongols.
- Properly implemented the 'gain a vassal title' plot.
- Increased chance of heresies appearing.
- Feudal taxation now goes from 5-25% instead of 0-40%, meaning that Feudal vassals are no longer completely tax exempt. This was done to add more of noticeable drawback for the player to be a vassal, since unlike vanilla your liege generally can't call on a significant portion of your troops.
- Slightly increased opinion malus for appointing a Castellan.
- If a Castellan revolts when you try to dismiss him, you will now gain claims on all his titles.
- You can now only appoint a single Castellan (reduced down from two).
- Castellans that are given King titles, numerous Duke titles or a large number of vassals are now more likely to revolt if you try to dismiss them.
- Rulers can now get claims on neighbouring titles via a random event.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the cooldown on Crusades/Jihads from working correctly.
- Crusades targeting a De Jure Kingdom of an existing Emperor of the same religion will now grant the land to that Emperor (so a Crusade targeting Germany would give the land taken to the HRE).
- When winning lands in a Crusade, you will now get an event that allows you to set up a relative as an independent ruler of a Crusader state, though you may also choose to hold on to the land as before.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Regency trait to not be removed correctly.
- Reduced the frequency of spouses falling in love with each other (it was happening rather too often since the event could fire for either spouse).
- Upped the piety cost of players calling Crusades/Jihads to 500.
- Added a 20 year cooldown on the player calling Crusades/Jihads.

1.05:
- Fixed a major issue that was causing certain CBs not to work.
- The AI will no longer grant Duchies to characters of a different religion.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Pagan bonus buildings from working.
- The King of Nubia in 1066 is now the correct culture.
- Calling a Crusade or Jihad now costs and requires 250 piety if the player is the one calling it.

1.04:
- Ported over all vanilla character history changes from 1.05.
- Added the decision to appoint up to two male, unlanded, non-primary heir characters as Castellans. Castellans are appointed governors of any titles you grant them, which can be retaken at any time with the 'Dismiss Castellan' decision, allowing you to use them as temporary governors of territory you cannot currently hold yourself, or wish to reserve for a relative in the future. The downside to Castellans is that they are much less efficient at ruling their territories, and will give you less 33% less tax and levies than an ordinary, landed vassal. Appointing Castellans will also slightly upset your hereditary vassals, who do not like the idea of appointed rulers. Muslims do not get Castellans since they have their own appointed ruler system. If a Castellan dies or inherits land, he immediately ceases to be a Castellan and his lands (not including any inheritance) returns to you.
- Empire-level titles will now inherit all laws properly from your primary title on creation.
- Investiture and Title crown laws are now tied to their De Jure Empire in the same way as crown authority.
- You can now press claims for female characters on titles with Cognatic succession. I tested allowing pressing claims on Agnatic-Cognatic but it made expansion far too easy by simply pressing claims for your wife.
- Increased piety cost of hiring Holy Orders.
- Holy Orders will now properly scale with time and religious authority.
- Reworked holy order troop composition to give some variety and also to prevent some holy orders from having an excess amount of certain troop types by end game.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'rebel army rises up' event from firing.
- Heresies now scale better to authority, so you get a gradual decrease/increase of heresies as authority goes up/down rather than a few massive thresholds.
- Reduced the base chance of heresies appearing.
- Reduced the effect of head of religion diplomacy on religious authority. The default state of Catholicism should no longer be 100%.
- Highway Robber Bands, Thieves' Guilds and Smuggler Rings can now appear for rulers without an oversized demesne if their realm stats are low.
- Childbirth deaths will now show up correctly as a death cause.
- Fixed some issues with broken death localisations.
- Reduced province de jure integration time back to 100 years.
- Pagans can now create Scandinavia and all its Kingdom titles.
- Removed all title creation exceptions for non-AI players. Muslim players can no longer create France, etc.
- Dutch provinces can now build the squire list line of buildings. This is a placeholder until I can give them their own building series.
- Many more titular titles are now createable.
- AI characters with the right traits may now choose to hold to Rome despite the Pope's demands.
- Added a CB for Catholic rulers to return Rome to the Pope if another ruler takes it.
- The Pope will now only ask for Rome back once. You won't get the same request for future rulers unless he took it back inbetween.
- Fixed a reversed localisation when rulers join the enemy side in a war.
- Rolled all the Holy War/Religious Invasion CBs into a single Holy War CB with varying piety costs depending on distance and sanction. This was done because the AI did not recognize the new religious CBs and would not join in defensively.
- Reduced AI willingness to join Holy Wars and Crusades.
- Removed the intrigue requirement on starting plots, but made low-intrigue AI characters unlikely to use them.
- Eased up on opinion restrictions on murder plots, especially for characters with traits such as ambitious and cruel.
- Crusades can no longer be declared against heretics, as this resulted in some extremely absurd situations.
- Winning a crusade will no longer give you the Kingdom title, as this resulted in absurdities like an english Duke becoming the King of Germany because of a crusade declared against Mecklenburg.
- Long reign now starts at year 20 instead of year 10.
- Increased opinion malus for denying a vassal a title when they request it via event.
- Reduced the opinion malusus from desiring titles and Not De Jure Liege. Since civil wars are now much more dangerous, I feel that it is a good idea to reduce their frequency a bit, especially to make the AI a more challenging opponent. The effects of these may be raised again if it makes the world too stable.
- The regency triggered modifier is now a trait, that only affects vassal opinion instead of general opinion.
- When a vassal revolts to depose their liege (either via one of the three depose CBs or through a succession crisis), all other vassals will now get an event where they can choose whether or not to join in the revolt. The chance to join depends on traits, relations and dynastic relationships. This should make it significantly more dangerous to provoke your vassals into revolting, since even a small revolt can spiral out of control.
- Tweaked crusade weight chances to cut down on crusades against Sicily and the Wends.
- Added the createable titular kingdom of Aquitaine. Aquitaine can only be created by Occitains that control Bordeaux, and since it is a King-level title you must be independent or the vassal of an Emperor to create it.
- Removed Republic bonus buildings.
- Removed Papal bonus buildings.
- Reduced the power of Pagan bonus buildings.
- Added 1.05's Kingdom/Empire De Jure CBs as an experiment to see whether it has the negative effects on balance that I feared.
- Fixed a bug that was causing friends not to work correctly.
- Disabled the wrong religion occupation penalty, as I feel Holy Wars have been slowed down / made difficult enough that it is not necessary.
- Reduced warscore from battles.
- Fixed some bugs where the 'Win a War' ambition would not complete correctly.
- Fixed a bug with asking for a Sanctioned Holy War where nothing would happen when you took the decision.
- Removed the optional heraldry module until a version can be made that works with the 1.05c patch.
- Fixed a bug where Crusader/Mujahid would not be properly assigned to characters.
- Split up or tweaked many of the largest duchies to make duchy sizes more consistent between different regions.

1.03:
- Added crusade weighting for Kingdoms, so crusades/jihads are not totally random.
- Muslims now have their own Mujahid trait instead of getting the Crusader trait.
- Emperors can no longer create King titles they are the De Jure liege of (to prevent some very ahistorical title creation).
- The character designer will now work properly with CK2+ (ie you can no longer start as a pregnant, beheaded man).
- Reduced the power of republic levy building and made it cost money to build in holdings that do not start with it.
- Made the special republic CB cost prestige to slow down their blobbing.
- Added new CoA patterns from 1.05 to Heraldry mod.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to crash if you tried to start after 1204.
- Characters can now plot to assassinate rivals.
- Rügen is now a de jure part of Pomerania.
- Now uses vanilla death reasons instead of death causes mod.

1.02:
- Now compatible with 1.05c. Certain things (like the Kingdom/Empire de jure CBs) were not ported because I feel they break gameplay balance.
- Reduced supply limits experimentally, to see how the improved military AI works out.
- Tribal Invasion CB now targets Kingdoms instead of Duchies.
- Upped De Jure assimilation rate to 200 years.
- Titular Kingdoms (such as the Wends) are now created through 1.05's create titular title mechanic instead of via decision.
- Reduced revolt risk from distance.
- Removed the civil war modifier for now, to see how the new +revolt risk from independence revolts works out. Regency modifier is still in place.
- Removed the war of independence winning all wars of independence mechanic, since new ticking warscore makes it redundant.
- Tweaked the way traits affect piety. All virtues will now give at least a small amount of monthly piety, while all sins will give at least a small malus. The effects of traits such as humble, chaste and lustful that already affected piety were tweaked down to compensate.
- A player that is holding a 'landless' title (such as a mercenary company or a holy order) will now receive a one-time warning that doing so can cause severe bugs with the game.
- Fixed a bug where Kingdom-level titles would sometimes not be grantable to your vassals.
- Rulers whose religion has a religious head can now request sanction for a Holy War or Religious Invasion at a small prestige cost. If granted, it will allow them to wage a Sanctioned Holy War/Religious Invasion that has no piety cost and will give you some piety if you win it. The chance of sanction being granted depends on your piety and head of religion's opinion of you. Requesting sanction can only be done once every five years.
- The AI will now be less keen on doling out its entire demesne to its sons.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'ruler goes native' event from firing.
- Fixed a bug that was causing you to get tyranny when a prisoner died in house arrest.
- Muslims can now get the Crusader trait for participating in Jihads. I will likely make a separate Jihadist trait at some point in the future.
- Temple holdings now give the province they're built in a 10% research boost, even if they don't have any research buildings built.
- You can no longer reorganize flanks. Until Paradox fixes the inherent balance issues with flanks the only real use for this is for player-only exploits.
- Reduced the size of the Norman, English and Norwegian armies in the Stamford Bridge scenario. While the armies are now smaller than they were historically, they are no longer confusingly out of sync with the actual army sizes in the rest of the mod.
- CK2Plus now features full French localisation.
- When taking or extending a loan you will now get a character modifier showing you when the loan is due.
- Restored the family trees that were broken to prevent certain claims from existing. Instead, those claims will be removed by a startup event that fires shortly after game start.
- You must no longer have the prestige on hand to fabricate claims, but you cannot fabricate claims if your prestige is below 0.
- The final level of Heavy Armor is now actually an upgrade.
- Titles created by decision will now inherit the succession law of your primary title (no more forming Empires with Gavelkind).
- You can no longer grant independence to De Jure vassals, to prevent certain exploits with De Jure CBs.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from abandoning certain failed plots and objectives.
- Renamed 'Get a Lover' to 'Fall in Love' to make it more appropriate for when the ambition is completed by falling in love with your spouse.
- Fixed a bug where 'Get a Lover' would abort if the character is chaste.
- Replaced the Pagan bonus buildings with culture buildings, so that foreign conquerors do not get the benefit of them.

1.01:
- CK2Plus now features full German localisation support.
- Contagious diseases are now rarer but more deadly.
- Changed scale of morale break threshold from 25-50% to 10-50% so martial skill is even more decisive.
- Added two new merc fleets, one in the black sea and the other near the holy land.
- Added five additional 500 man merc groups, non-hireable by the AI (located in: baltic, germany, balkans, egypt, arabia).
- Holy Wars will no longer result in gaining the target Duchy title, as it has proved impossible to fix the bugs and weird vassals gained from doing so.
- AI characters can now a pick a 'cooldown' ambition that is meant to reduce the frequency of murder plots occuring simply because they have nothing else to do.
- Added new ambitions: Convert a Province, Win a War, Gain Honorary Title, Adopt a Lifestyle, Gain a Kingdom and Become Emperor.
- Characters must now have at least 5 intrigue to start a plot.
- Religious conversion chance is now increased by having a large demesne.
- You must now be independent to grant a vassal independence.
- Granting independence to a De Jure vassal now costs 100 prestige, compared to 25 for releasing a not De Jure vassal.
- It no longer costs piety to imprison, exile or execute characters. While I think the piety costs make sense, it's rather strange that the actions are impossible to carry out if your piety is negative - why would low piety stop a cynical, depraved character from killing anyone?
- You can now declare war on characters that are either plotting to kill your close relatives or sheltering characters plotting to kill your close relatives in their realm. A victory will imprison all such plotters in your dungeon.
- Legitimizing Bastards is now done under Character Decisions.
- You can now declare Religious Defense on a ruler whose vassals are fighting some form of Holy War.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now also end all variants of offensive Holy Wars their vassals are fighting against characters of your religion.
- The AI will no longer fight third-party claim wars where the claimaint would not end up as their vassal.
- The third-party claim war tooltip will now show you whether the claimaint will end up becoming your vassal after the peace or not.
- You can no longer declare third-party claim wars on a character that you already installed in a title via another third-party claim war. This is to prevent players from repeatedly invading the same County for prestige..
- Provinces with a revolt in progress should now show up as deep red on the revolt risk map.
- Gender succession laws can now only be changed one 'step' at a time (so you can't change from Agnatic to Cognatic or vice-versa, you have to first make it Agnatic-Cognatic).
- Revoking a title now always costs 100 prestige (to prevent a Muslim ruler from going completely nuts with revocations).
- Muslim rulers can now appoint up to 3 concubines from unmarried women in their court. Concubines will have legitimate children with their liege. If a concubine gets married or moves to a different court, she ceases to be a concubine.
- Muslim vassals can now plot to institute hereditary titles.
- Muslim rulers now have a new crown law category: Titles. This crown law determines whether titles can be freely revoked (without relation hits to other vassals), representing the Muslim system of appointed rather than hereditary rulers. Having the free revocation law in effect will make your vassals like you less, and they can still refuse and revolt when you try to revoke their titles.
- Reworked the Award Honorary Title diplomatic action into a Character Decisions menu that contains both honorary titles and new character decisions.
- Added the 'Grant Independence' character decision that allows you to set a vassal free at the cost of a relations and prestige hit.
- Added the 'Revoke Honorary Title' character decision that allows you to revoke an honorary title. This will cause a relations hit unless the title you were revoking was that of Court Jester.
- Tweaked Papal name list to contain mostly names that were actually used during the CK2 era.
- Restored the Almoravid claims but made them an Emirate instead of a Sultanate in 1066, to give other Muslim rulers in the area a fighting chance.
- Split the Duchy of Marrakech into the Duchies of Marrakech and Ifni.
- Fixed some bugs with holy orders.
- Scaled Amass Wealth and Become Exalted Among Men ambitions to your title rank, to make them more feasible to achieve for a Count and more difficult to achieve for a King or Emperor.
- Reduced frequency of non immediate family (sibling or child) relatives asking you for titles.
- Relatives who are offended by your refusal to give them a title may now plot to force the issue.
- Relatives who ask for titles will now usually be offended if you deny them. If you have decent diplomacy you may be able avoid offending them.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from executing assassination plots.
- The AI will now abandon objectives after ten years of failing to fulfill them.
- Prestigious vassals can now plot to acquire their liege's primary title, even if they do not have a claim on it.
- Vassals can now plot against a liege that is not their top liege, making it more dangerous for a vassal lord to anger their own vassals.
- Fixed a bug with Arrange Courtier Marriages where it would spawn multiple women with the same name.
- Rebalanced the effects of levy laws. They will provide less minimum levies, but have less of an impact on relations as well.
- There are now five levels of each tax and levy law instead of four. This means that realms with an active crown law will always be able to have higher law settings than one completely without.
- Fixed a persistent bug where children would always be stillborn if their mother died in childbirth.
- Reduced the overall frequency of genetics traits when not inherited from parents (so you'll have less dwarven hunchback debutantes showing up at court).
- Decreased chance of inheriting Quick, Genius, Slow and Imbecile.
- Increased chance of inheriting Tall.
- Fabricating claims now has a fixed gold cost equal to the prestige cost. However, unlike prestige you do not need to have the gold on hand.
- Reduced the number of heavy cavalry gained from the German/Frankish culture buildings.

1.00:
- It is now possible to sail between the Nile Delta and the Gulf of Suez. This is necessary because otherwise the AI has issues with getting its troops stuck waiting for ships on the other side.
- Added decisions to form special titular Kingdoms for Muslims in Iberia.
- Reduced piety gain from handing titles to church, so that it is not possible to wage perpetual Holy War simply by handing out the temples you gain.
- A white peace in an independence war will no longer result in independence.
- Winning an independence war will now result in all other independence wars against the same target being automatically won. Ideally I would have liked to make independence war a war where you can call in other vassals who also become independent if you win, but this does not seem to be possible to do.
- Winning a war to replace your liege (by any of the various CBs) will now end any wars with the same general goal inconclusively.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now end any offensive Crusade or Religious Wars the enemy is fighting against your religion. Any other Religious Defense wars your faith is waging against the same target will also end inconclusively.
- It is now possible to wage Holy War against distant enemies. Such a war is distinguished by a different name: Religious Invasion. A Religious Invasion costs 250 piety and cannot be declared if your piety is below 0.
- It now costs 100 piety to wage a Holy War on a neighbouring enemy. You cannot declare a Holy War if your piety is below 0. This is meant to represent Church/Temple approval of your war, and also to slow down the general pace of expansion.
- Changed the way invasions work. Instead of taking all occupied titles, you now get all titles the target character was holding which fall under the Kingdom you were invading. So if William wins the Norman Invasion, he takes the Kingdom of England and all English Counties, Duchies and Baronies Harold was holding.
- Pagans can now wage Holy Wars.
- Made the AI more reluctant to expand into Ethiopia.
- Axum is once again independent at game start.
- Added preferred terrain types for different unit/tactics. For instance, Pikemen will perform better in hills and mountains but poorly in forests, while light cavalry will do well in forests and deserts but poorly in mountains.
- Changed all battle tactic stats into standardized formulas.
- Linked battle morale break point with generals martial stat (flanks with no general will break at 50% morale, decreasing in increments to 25% break point at 20+ martial skill).
- Added mild defensive bonuses to most terrain types.
- Added the Have Fifteen Children and Have Twenty Children ambitions. Completing the Have Twenty Children ambition will give you a special nickname.
- Orthodox Priests can now marry.
- AI Barons will now get married instead of letting their dynasties die out.
- Feasts, Grand Hunts and Summer Fairs now cost a fixed amount of money depending on your title rank. Many of the events related to them have also been given fixed gold costs.
- Titular titles can no longer have Elective succession (as they have no valid electors).
- You now have a small chance of fabricating claims on a Duchy, even if your Chancellor has < 15 skill.
- Your chance of successfully fabricating a claim is now increased by having high prestige.
- Increased the prestige cost of fabricating claims to 200/500 for County/Duchy.
- Increased the wrong holding type penalty to -66%.
- Reduced the effects of ambitious and content to -30/+30 respectively.
- Added a decision to automatically arrange marriages for all eligible bachelors in your court. The characters will primarily marry women in your court, but if there is not enough women then random spouses will be generated for them. This decision is meant for people like me who like to have a large court but don't want to go through the tedious micromanagement of finding spouses for every male courtier. Close relatives of yours will not be affected by this decision, so you won't accidentally marry your son or daughter to a courtier.
- Switching out of Elective now requires High Crown Authority.
- Localisation should no longer be a mess in non-default language settings, though all the text from the mod will be in English.
- Tweaked province names, laws and borders in Poland.
- Integrated the 'Offer You Can't Refuse' mod that adds Sicilian cultural melting pots.
- Characters now have a 5% chance of gaining the culture of their province shortly after birth.
- Rulers can now 'go native', converting them and any children of theirs below the age of 16 to the culture of their capital province. Kings and Emperors are much less likely to go native. The chance to go native goes down with age. The player gets an option to avoid it happening to their character.
- Removed Warrior Cults. Instead, Pagans start with more regular troop buildings.
- East Africa, Sicily and Christian Iberia now start with more troop buildings.
- Removed the direct warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Doubled the yearly warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Tweaked it so that Barons can't convert the culture of a province. This should slow down rate of culture conversion.
- Reduced truce time for Ducal Claim wars to 6 years.
- Reduced truce time for County Claim wars to 3 years.
- The ruler of Mallorca in 1066 is now much more historical.
- Religious Head and Holy Order titles will now automatically convert characters holding them to their religion.
- Rebalanced province values in Russia and Scandinavia. Overall development potential of provinces was reduced.
- You will no longer have vassals declare independence wars without warning. Instead, vassal revolt risk and effects of regencies/civil wars were tweaked so that revolt chain reactions should happen on their own (see below).
- Added a decision to become King of Wends if you are Wend Pagan ruler that holds the Duchies of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Pommerania or Pomeralia either directly or through vassals.
- The AI will now make proper use of demesne laws.
- Tax laws are now tied to crown authority in the same way as Levy laws. Default tax laws are None for Feudal vassals and Minimum for Church and City vassals. This should put large Duchies at more of a disadvantage to proper Kingdoms.
- Added the county of Teate in Benevento to make the borders between Sicily and Lombardy more historical.
- Fixed some bugs related to heresies.
- You will no longer get tyranny from characters dying in your prison unless they died as a result of illnesses contracted from being in prison.
- Sick or injured prisoners will now ask for better accomondations, even if they were previously denied them. This is meant to give the player a second chance to avoid a tyranny hit if a prisoner falls ill.
- The dungeon and the oubliette no longer give direct health maluses, instead they make it much more likely to catch an illness.
- Rebalanced the Mongols to have fewer but larger stacks.
- Reduced the effects of dynastic prestige on marriages and newly born characters (having babies born with 500 prestige was getting silly).
- Winning a Holy War or Crusade will now result in taking the Duchy title the war was for, if the enemy is holding it. You still get all the holdings in the Duchy.
- Created an event will make the AI much smarter about handing out newly created Duchy titles, preferring to give them to Counts with their capital in the right area, or alternatively granting them along with a County to a Courtier, only granting a Duke title to an existing Duke if there are no better alternatives. This will only sometimes work on revoked/usurped titles, as the AI is sometimes too fast for my handout event to take effect.
- The Duchy of Tyrol is no longer divided by impassable mountains.
- Tweaked some weirdly shaped provinces.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in Algiers, and added the Duchy of Atlas.
- Added Ibiza as a County in the Duchy of Mallorca.
- Added the Kingdom of Azerbaijan as a de jure part of the Empire of Persia, composed of the Duchies of Tabriz, Azerbaijan and Derbent.
- Pommerania is now de jure a part of Germany.
- Salzburg is now a de jure part of Austria.
- Grisons is now a de jure part of Tyrol.
- Viviers is now a de jure part of Auvergne.
- Anhalt is now a de jure part of Brandenburg.
- Fejer is now a de jure part of Esztergom.
- Vendome is now a de jure part of Anjou.
- Damman and Basra are now de jure parts of Arabia.
- Jacwiez and Yatvagi are now de jure part of Lithuania.
- Rebellions will now rarely result in a large rebel army rising up. If the rebels take control of a province, the chance of bad rebel events (like burned buildings or killed province lords) increases, and the province may defect.
- Integrated 'culturally different cities' mod which gives different culture groups their own distinct city graphics.
- Rebalanced culture buildings so that different culture groups are roughly on part with each other.
- Cost of tech growth buildings is now consistent at 200 gold per 10% growth speed the building confers.
- Khazars now start with 2 provinces, and Itil was split into the Duchies of Itil and Saray so that nobody will have a ducal claim on them. This should give them a chance of surviving past the first five minutes of the game.
- Reduced the relations penalty for title claimaints.
- Stressed and Depressed are now mutually exclusive.
- When a character with the dishonorable trait dies, their heir will now get a 'dynastic stain' trait that confers diplomatic penalties equal to their predecessor's level of dishonorable, but which does not qualify you for excommunication or other ill effects of being dishonorable. If a character with dynastic stain is caught assassinating, the dynastic stain turns into a regular dishonorable trait at one level above what their dynastic stain level was at. Assuming you keep dynastic stain from being turned into dishonorable, it will not be transferred over to your heir. This change is meant to  add additional risk to inheritance-by-assassination, as you can now not simply wash away the consequenses by dying.
