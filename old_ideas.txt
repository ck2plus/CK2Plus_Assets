* Minor Titles:
	- Give some sort of meaning for the minor titles so they're not entirely pointless for everything but mood (also restrict Court Jester to courtiers already angry with you or remove it entirely. Rivals only maybe?)

* Arabic Pagan religion notes:
	- Distinction between nomadic and tribal beliefs (is this possible in game mechanics?)
	- Nomads focused on deities of immediate concerns (e.g. health, water)
	- Tribals worshipped a creator sky/rain deity called Allah as chief deity. Only asked for his help in extreme situations due to his chiefly status "beyond the supplications of normal people"
	- Most powerful "accessible" deities were his daughters "Allat", "al-Uzza", and Manat
	- Deserts were considered the abode of the Jinn. Beings made of smoke and flame (behave similar to nymphs and fairies in western mythos)
	- No priests, instead had "cultic officials" known as the "Kahins" who were "poets who functioned primarily as soothsayers and who, for a fee, would fall into a trance in which they would reveal divine messages through rhyming couplets" "Kahins did not communicate directly with the gods but rather accessed them through the Jinn and other spirits who were such an integral part of the Jahiliyyah religious experience." (we'll probably use the Kahins as Priests)
	- Allah was not in the Kabaah but was still of primary importance. Central deity in the Kabaah was called Hubal and is a Syrian god (Huzzah! May be able to find information about him!) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubal)
	- Processional chant as approaching the Kabbah: "Here I am, O Allah, here I am. You have no partner, Except such a partner as you have. You possess him and all that is his."
	- Henotheistic, meaning they accepted Allah as high god without rejecting the existance of other gods. (Fascinating!)
	- Hajj and the tawaf ritual are pre-islamic. Arabic pagans on Hajj would shave their heads. (second part may not be simulatable, but we can DEFINITELY make Hajj accessible to the arab pagans)

	- Children had sacred duty to care for parents. Sons were responsible for burying them and maintaining the tombs. (Perhaps flavor events referencing this)
	- Maybe give access to some "Jewish-only" mechanics?
