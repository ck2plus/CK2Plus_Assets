First up, you need the latest version of Python 3.

To use the script, just double click it (after installing Python 3 obviously). It will ask for what culture (use the code) to check for gaps, and it will automatically export the results to a file called gaps.txt (if there's a file called gaps.txt in the folder already, it will append to it).

Make sure to open the dynasty files and CTRL-F to make sure the supposed gaps aren't actually there but they were placed in the wrong order. If they are, make sure to loudly complain about Paradox and the Swedes in general on the Paradox Forums.
