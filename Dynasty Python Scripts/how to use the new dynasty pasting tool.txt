First up, you need the latest version of Python 3.

To use the script, just double click it (after installing Python 3 obviously).
It will ask you the dynasty names. Press return after every dynasty. Press return without typing anything to quit. Yes, you can copy-paste lists (if your terminal supports it, Windows' command line does), as long as they each on their own line.
After that it will ask you for the culture for them to be added to.
By some abstract Great Old Ones rituals, it will then automagically grab the last number, +1 it, and paste those cultures in 01_dynasties.txt. Numbered and all.

NOTE: Make sure there's always an empty newline before you use it. The script will make add one when it's done.
